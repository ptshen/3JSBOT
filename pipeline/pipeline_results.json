  "analysis": "RATING: 0.95  \nANALYSIS: The image accurately represents a spinning cube generated in Three.js. As a static screenshot of an animated scene, the green square is the front face of a cube captured at a moment when it aligns with the camera's view (consistent with a spinning cube's behavior). The reference description emphasizes generating a spinning cube, not specific color or motion artifacts. While the cube appears as a flat square (not showing three faces like a corner view), this is expected in a single frame of a rotating object\u2014this is the same logic used in the provided example where a spinning cube is evaluated as a square in a static frame. The color (green) is irrelevant per the reference description since it does not specify color requirements. No critical elements are missing, and spatial relationships (cube centered on black background) match expected Three.js behavior. Minor discrepancies (e.g., color choice) are negligible and do not affect core validation.",
