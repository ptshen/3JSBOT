# ASCII Art 3D Sculpture in Three.js

## Scene Description

This is a striking ASCII art rendering created in three.js, featuring a **sculptural bust or head form** constructed entirely from text characters arranged in 3D space.

### Key Visual Elements:

**Structure & Composition:**
- The figure appears to be a classical-style bust or portrait head, oriented upright and facing forward
- It's constructed from thousands of individual ASCII characters (primarily dots, dashes, and other symbols) that create volumetric depth
- The character density varies to suggest form, shadow, and surface topology

**Dimensional Form:**
- A rounded cranium/head at the top
- Suggested facial features in the middle section
- A broader base that tapers downward, implying shoulders or a pedestal
- Clear relief and dimensionality through character layering

**Visual Technique:**
- **Depth mapping**: Characters are positioned at different depths to create the 3D silhouette
- **Tonal variation**: Denser character clusters represent darker/recessed areas, while sparser regions suggest highlights
- **Geometric precision**: The arrangement creates clean edges and well-defined contours

**Rendering Style:**
- White/light characters against pure black background for maximum contrast
- Orthographic or isometric-like perspective
- Monochromatic, minimalist aesthetic

This represents a creative fusion of **low-tech ASCII art with modern 3D graphics technology**, producing an elegant, sculptural visualization.
