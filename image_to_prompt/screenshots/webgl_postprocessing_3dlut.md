# 3D Scene Description: Futuristic Robotic Head in High-Tech Environment

## Main Subject
A highly detailed **biomechanical robotic head** occupies the center of the composition. The design features:

- **Sleek, angular geometry** with a predominantly **black metallic finish**
- **Glowing cyan/blue accents** forming intricate circuit patterns and details across the surface, particularly around the cranium and face regions
- **Golden/brass-colored mechanical components** visible on the sides and structural elements, adding warmth to the cool color palette
- **Translucent or glass-like elements** suggesting advanced technological integration
- **Organic yet synthetic aesthetic** - bridging biological and mechanical design principles

## Environment
- **Gallery-like corridor** with pristine white/cream colored walls
- **Polished wooden flooring** with a herringbone or similar refined pattern
- **Ambient lighting installations** on the walls featuring circular glowing panels in warm orange and cool blue tones, creating an immersive exhibition atmosphere
- **Professional museum or showroom setting** suggesting this is a curated technological art display

## Lighting & Aesthetics
- **Dramatic three-point lighting setup** with strategic spotlighting
- **High contrast** between the dark metallic head and bright environment
- **Neon-influenced color grading** (cyberpunk aesthetic) with cool blues balanced against warm amber tones
- **Professional depth of field** with slight foreground blur and sharp focus on the robotic sculpture

The overall composition evokes themes of **AI, transhumanism, and advanced robotics** in a contemporary gallery context.
