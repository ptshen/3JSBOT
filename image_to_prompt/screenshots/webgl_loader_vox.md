# 3D Castle Tower Scene Description

## Overall Structure
This is an isometric view of a detailed medieval castle tower rendered in three.js with a minimalist, geometric aesthetic. The architecture features a distinctive cream/beige color palette with warm accent lighting.

## Architectural Elements

**Upper Structure:**
- Two prominent cylindrical towers with crenellated (notched) tops, positioned at the front corners
- Decorative finials or ornamental spheres crowning each tower

**Main Body:**
- A square/rectangular central tower with tall arched windows or alcoves
- Regular grid pattern of stone blocks visible on the outer walls, emphasizing the masonry construction
- Multiple levels indicated by horizontal architectural divisions
- Classical medieval castle proportions with thick, sturdy walls

**Lower Foundation:**
- A wider base platform providing structural stability
- Subtle depth suggesting multiple foundation levels

## Lighting & Materials
- **Primary Illumination:** Warm, golden-orange accent lights positioned strategically on the left side of the structure, creating dramatic shadows and depth
- **Material Finish:** Matte stone texture with subtle variations in tone
- **Shadow Rendering:** Realistic shadow mapping emphasizes the 3D geometry and architectural details

## Technical Presentation
- Black background isolating the model
- Clean, professional render quality
- Isometric perspective providing excellent visibility of all surfaces
- Geometric precision typical of three.js architectural visualization
