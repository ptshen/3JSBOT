# Detailed Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a stunning neoclassical terrace rendered in three.js, featuring a grand classical colonnade overlooking a dramatic Mediterranean landscape. The scene demonstrates sophisticated architectural visualization with excellent lighting and atmospheric effects.

## Architectural Elements

**Columns & Structure:**
- Six prominent Corinthian columns with ornate capitals frame the terrace
- The columns are rendered with realistic stone texture and warm terracotta/rust tones
- Classical balustrades line both sides of the terrace, featuring decorative urns and planters
- Ornamental stone pedestals with sculptural details anchor the space

**Floor:**
- An intricate checkerboard pattern in blue and white marble creates a classical Italian villa aesthetic
- The geometric precision of the tiling demonstrates advanced texture mapping and perspective rendering
- Strong linear perspective emphasizes depth toward the landscape beyond

## Landscaping
- Manicured topiary in white planters provides organic softness against rigid classical forms
- Strategic greenery placement frames the view and adds life to the stone structure

## Lighting & Atmosphere

**Quality of Light:**
- Warm, golden-hour sunlight streams through the colonnade creating dramatic linear shadows across the floor
- Shadows from the columns create a striking striped pattern, enhancing depth perception
- Realistic shadow rendering with proper occlusion and falloff

**Sky:**
- Beautifully rendered cloud formations with volumetric lighting effects
- Natural gradient from blue to warm tones suggesting either sunrise or sunset
- Atmospheric perspective visible in the distant landscape

## Background Landscape
- A dramatic Mediterranean coastal vista featuring towering limestone cliffs
- Layered depth with mountains, coastline, and settlement visible
- The landscape appears inspired by locations like the Amalfi Coast or similar Italian coastal regions

## Technical Achievement
- Realistic material rendering with proper specularity on marble and stone
- Sophisticated shadow mapping and global illumination simulation
- Strong depth of field perception through atmospheric haze
- Excellent balance between architectural precision and natural elements
