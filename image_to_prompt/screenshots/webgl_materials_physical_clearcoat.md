# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a professionally rendered 3D scene featuring four spheres of varying materials and finishes arranged in a 2x2 grid formation, photographed against an urban architectural backdrop.

## Sphere Details

**Top Left - Blue Metallic Sphere**
- Highly polished, mirror-like reflective surface
- Deep cobalt blue color with specular highlights
- Exhibits sharp reflections of the surrounding environment
- Positioned at the upper-left quadrant

**Top Right - Dark Striped Sphere**
- Textured surface with horizontal striping pattern
- Black and dark gray color palette
- Matte finish with subtle directional lighting
- Creates visual contrast with the reflective balls

**Bottom Left - White Golf Ball**
- Classic dimpled surface texture (golf ball pattern)
- Bright white color with soft matte finish
- Demonstrates realistic subsurface scattering and soft shadows
- Smallest apparent size or positioned furthest back

**Bottom Right - Red Glossy Sphere**
- Vibrant red color with semi-gloss finish
- Smooth, polished surface with pronounced specular highlights
- Strong reflectivity while maintaining color saturation

## Lighting & Environment
- Warm, golden hour lighting creating ambient illumination
- Soft shadows cast beneath each sphere
- Urban background with warm-toned building textures and windows
- Depth of field effect with focused foreground and blurred background
- Professional three.js rendering with physically-based materials

This scene effectively demonstrates material diversity and lighting techniques in 3D visualization.
