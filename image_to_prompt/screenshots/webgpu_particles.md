# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist three.js scene featuring a vast, curved horizontal plane extending to the horizon with a subtle grid texture overlay.

## Lighting and Atmosphere
- **Primary Light Source**: A warm, orange-yellow light positioned centrally in the middle distance
- **Lighting Style**: The light appears to be a point light or spotlight creating a soft, diffused glow
- **Color Temperature**: Warm amber/orange tones dominate, suggesting either sunrise/sunset conditions or artificial warm lighting
- **Shadows**: Soft shadow casting on the plane surface, with the light creating a subtle glow effect

## Surface/Geometry
- **Ground Plane**: A large, slightly curved or warped horizontal surface (possibly using displacement mapping)
- **Texture**: Fine grid lines visible across the surface, typical of procedural or geometric subdivision
- **Material**: Matte, dark gray/charcoal base material that contrasts with the warm light
- **Perspective**: The plane appears to curve away toward the horizon, creating a sense of infinite depth

## Lighting Effects
- **Bloom/Glow**: The light source has a noticeable bloom effect, creating atmospheric light diffusion
- **Global Illumination**: Subtle ambient lighting providing minimal fill light to the scene

## Overall Mood
The scene evokes a cinematic, ethereal quality—possibly representing a sci-fi landscape, a digital void, or an abstract concept of illumination in darkness.
