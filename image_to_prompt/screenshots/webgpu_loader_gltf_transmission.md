# 3D Scene Description: Floating Glass Dome with Spheres

## Overall Composition
This is an elegant three.js rendered scene featuring a transparent glass dome suspended against a soft, gradient background. The scene demonstrates sophisticated lighting and material rendering techniques.

## Primary Elements

### Glass Dome Structure
- **Form**: A clear, semi-translucent glass hemisphere with a conical spire/finial on top
- **Material**: High-quality glass shader with visible refraction and reflection properties
- **Transparency**: Allows interior contents to be viewed while maintaining glass surface definition
- **Base**: A decorative turquoise/cyan-colored plate or base that anchors the composition

### Interior Spheres Collection
The dome contains approximately 12-15 decorative spheres in various colors:
- **Color palette**: Warm golds, deep burgundies, navy blues, and amber tones
- **Arrangement**: Organic, scattered positioning suggesting they're resting naturally within the dome
- **Material**: Matte to semi-glossy finish with realistic shading

## Lighting & Atmosphere
- **Background**: Soft warm-to-cool gradient (peachy-tan to lavender-gray)
- **Lighting**: Ambient illumination with strategic highlights on the glass surfaces
- **Shadows**: Subtle, soft shadows suggesting studio-quality 3D rendering
- **Depth of Field**: Slight blur in the background creating dimensional separation

## Technical Qualities
- Clean geometry and smooth surface rendering
- Realistic material properties with proper Fresnel effects on glass
- Professional color grading and post-processing
- Centered, balanced composition with symmetrical framing

This appears to be a product visualization or decorative illustration with museum-quality presentation.
