# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a stunning radial visualization rendered in Three.js featuring a perfect circle against a pure black background. The scene demonstrates sophisticated use of color gradients and geometric construction.

## Visual Elements

**Central Sphere/Disk:**
- A perfectly circular form positioned at the center of the viewport
- Radius appears to extend to approximately 40-45% of the canvas width
- Composed of countless thin radial lines emanating from a single central point

**Color Gradient (top to bottom):**
- **Top**: Bright lime yellow-green
- **Upper-middle**: Vibrant cyan and turquoise
- **Center**: Clear transition zone
- **Lower-middle**: Deep sky blue
- **Bottom**: Rich purple and magenta tones
- The gradient appears smooth and continuous, utilizing the full HSL/HSV spectrum

**Radial Line Work:**
- Hundreds of thin geometric lines radiating outward from the center point
- Lines create a fibrous, organic texture despite being mathematically precise
- Line opacity and density remains consistent throughout
- Creates a "sunburst" or "pinwheel" effect

## Technical Characteristics
- Clean, professional rendering with anti-aliasing
- High polygon/line count for smooth appearance
- Likely uses a custom shader or material with radial symmetry
- Minimal scene setup: just the shape and black background (THREE.Color(0x000000))

This appears to be a color wheel or hue spectrum visualization, possibly used for color selection or as a generative art piece.
