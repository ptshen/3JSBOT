# Minecraft-Inspired Three.js Terrain Scene

## Overview
This is a stylized, low-polygon 3D terrain visualization rendered with three.js, featuring a distinctly retro, voxel-based aesthetic reminiscent of Minecraft's visual style.

## Scene Components

### Terrain Layers
The landscape is composed of three distinct horizontal strata:

1. **Grass Layer (Top)** - A vibrant lime-green plane with a pixelated grid pattern, representing the surface terrain. The texture features subtle tiling that creates a checkerboard-like appearance with slight color variations.

2. **Dirt/Stone Layer (Middle)** - A tan and brown textured band running horizontally across the middle section, representing subsurface soil and stone blocks. The coloration suggests different mineral compositions with warm earth tones.

3. **Grass Plane (Foreground)** - The immediate foreground features a flat green plane with bold pixelated grid divisions, creating depth and perspective as it recedes toward the horizon.

### Lighting & Atmosphere
- **Sky** - A soft, muted blue gradient background suggesting a clear day
- **Lighting** - Flat, ambient lighting typical of three.js default rendering, with minimal shadows, creating a clean, almost isometric appearance

### Perspective & Composition
The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking slightly upward at the terrain formation, creating a sense of standing on the ground plane looking at distant terrain formations. The composition emphasizes horizontal stratification and the repetitive grid texture inherent to voxel-based design.

This represents a fundamental building block for procedural terrain generation systems commonly used in web-based 3D games and visualizations.
