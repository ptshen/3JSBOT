# 3D Scene Description

## Overview
This is a minimalist 3D rendered scene created with Three.js, featuring a single geometric object against a neutral environment.

## Key Elements

**Primary Object:**
- A bright **lime/neon green cube** positioned in the center-upper portion of the frame
- The cube appears to be a perfect hexahedron with clean, sharp edges
- The material has a matte or slightly diffuse finish with minimal reflectivity

**Lighting:**
- **Soft, ambient lighting** dominates the scene, creating gentle shadows
- A subtle shadow is cast beneath and slightly to the right of the cube, indicating a light source positioned above and to the left
- The lighting is diffuse and even, with no harsh highlights or dramatic contrast

**Environment:**
- **Light gray gradient background** that transitions subtly from lighter at the top to slightly darker toward the horizon
- A **white/light gray ground plane** that extends to the vanishing point, creating a clean, minimalist aesthetic
- The environment appears to be using basic Three.js default lighting and staging

**Camera & Composition:**
- The cube is positioned slightly off-center and elevated, creating visual interest
- The viewpoint is an isometric or slightly angled orthographic perspective
- The composition is clean and uncluttered, emphasizing the simplicity of the scene

**Overall Style:**
This is a classic demonstration scene—typical of basic Three.js tutorials or product showcases—highlighting core 3D rendering principles with minimal complexity.
