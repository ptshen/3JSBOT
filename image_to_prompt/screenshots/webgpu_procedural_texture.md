# Three.js Scene Description

## Overview
This is a minimalist 3D visualization featuring a **checkerboard pattern rendered as a textured plane or cube face** against a clean black background.

## Key Elements

### Geometry
- **Primary Object**: A square plane or cube face positioned in the center-left portion of the viewport
- **Scale**: Medium-sized, occupying roughly 15-20% of the frame width

### Material & Texture
- **Pattern**: Classic black and white checkerboard
- **Grid Composition**: Appears to be an 8×8 or similar grid of alternating squares
- **Texture Quality**: The pattern shows slight pixelation/aliasing, suggesting either a lower-resolution texture or minimal anti-aliasing

### Lighting & Shading
- **Illumination**: Evenly lit with subtle shading, indicating a simple lighting setup (likely one or two directional or ambient lights)
- **Shadow/Depth**: Minimal shadows, suggesting the scene prioritizes clarity over photorealism
- **Surface Quality**: Appears to have a slightly diffuse material

### Composition
- **Background**: Solid black, providing strong contrast
- **Camera Angle**: Appears to be a slightly angled orthographic or perspective view
- **Camera Position**: Positioned to show the plane at a slight 3D angle, suggesting depth

## Overall Aesthetic
Clean, geometric, and educational—typical of a basic three.js demonstration or learning exercise focusing on texture mapping and simple 3D geometry.
