# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist 3D rendered scene featuring a modern, abstract composition set against a neutral dark gray background. The scene demonstrates clean lighting and professional material rendering typical of high-quality three.js implementations.

## Central Element
At the center-top of the composition sits a **stylized 3D question mark symbol** rendered in white/light gray. The question mark features:
- Smooth, rounded geometry with subtle surface variations
- Organic, flowing curves that give it a contemporary feel
- Soft shading and shadows that suggest ambient lighting
- A polished surface with slight reflectivity

## Base Platform
Below the question mark sits a **dark gray/charcoal rectangular platform or stage** that:
- Serves as a ground plane and visual anchor
- Has minimal shadow definition, suggesting even lighting
- Creates visual stability for the composition

## Foreground Objects
Arranged in a horizontal line on the platform are **four rectangular blocks** displaying primary and secondary colors:
1. **Beige/cream** box (far left)
2. **Bright red** box (center-left)
3. **Dark blue** box (center-right)
4. **Vibrant red** box (far right)

These blocks appear to be simple geometric primitives with flat surfaces and clean edges, likely representing UI elements or design tokens.

## Lighting & Atmosphere
- Soft, diffused lighting with no harsh shadows
- Professional material rendering with subtle specularity
- The overall aesthetic suggests themes of inquiry, choice, or design selection
