## Object Details

**Wooden Crate:**
- **Material**: Wood texture with a golden-brown color palette
- **Appearance**: Classic cargo/shipping crate design with visible wood grain and planks

- **Positioning**: Centered in the frame with comfortable negative space

## Overall Aesthetic
The scene has a stylized, game-ready appearance with clean geometry and warm, inviting textures—suitable for a casual game, interactive application, or 3D asset showcase.
