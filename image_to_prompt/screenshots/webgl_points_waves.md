# Three.js Scene Description

## Overview
This is a minimalist 3D scene featuring a horizontal arrangement of three white spheres against a pure black background, with an organic, cloud-like structure connecting them above.

## Key Elements

### Spheres
- **Quantity**: Three evenly-spaced white spheres
- **Positioning**: Arranged horizontally across the viewport in a linear formation
- **Material**: Appears to be a basic white material with full opacity
- **Scale**: Roughly uniform in size, positioned at approximately equal intervals

### Connecting Structure
- **Description**: An organic, irregular white form spanning the top of the composition
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Cloud-like or cellular appearance with varied bumpy texture
  - Appears to connect or float above the three spheres
  - Highly irregular silhouette with protruding bulges and concave sections
  - Resembles aggregated spheres or a metaball simulation effect

## Lighting & Atmosphere
- **Lighting**: Simple, diffuse illumination creating uniform white coloring with minimal shadows
- **Background**: Solid black, providing stark contrast
- **Rendering Style**: Clean, minimal aesthetic typical of WebGL demonstrations

## Overall Impression
This composition suggests either a particle system visualization, a molecular structure representation, or an abstract artistic piece emphasizing geometric simplicity and organic form.
