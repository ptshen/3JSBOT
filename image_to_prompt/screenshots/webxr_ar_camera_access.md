# 3D Scene Description

## Overview
This is a minimalist three.js scene featuring a single geometric object set against a pure black background.

## Key Elements

**Primary Object:**
- A **white/light lavender cube** positioned in the upper-center portion of the viewport
- The cube appears to be rendered with flat shading or minimal lighting
- It has a clean, slightly desaturated white color (approximately RGB: 230, 230, 245)
- The cube maintains crisp edges without visible anti-aliasing artifacts

**Lighting:**
- Uniform, neutral lighting setup with no dramatic shadows or highlights
- The cube's faces are uniformly lit, suggesting either ambient lighting or a frontal light source
- No shadow casting visible on the background plane

**Environment:**
- Stark black background (RGB: 0, 0, 0) providing maximum contrast
- No visible ground plane, skybox, or environmental elements
- Clean, clinical appearance typical of technical 3D demonstrations

**Camera Perspective:**
- Slightly elevated viewing angle, positioning the cube off-center vertically
- Orthographic or wide perspective view
- The cube appears to be roughly 60-70 pixels in width on screen

## Overall Impression
This is a basic, no-frills 3D rendering—ideal for testing three.js functionality, demonstrating core 3D concepts, or serving as a template for more complex scenes.
