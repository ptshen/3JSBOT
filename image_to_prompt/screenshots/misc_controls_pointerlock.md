# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Aesthetic
This is a stylized, low-poly 3D environment rendered in Three.js with a dreamlike, abstract quality. The scene employs a pastel color palette dominated by cool tones—muted blues, purples, teals, and grays—creating a serene, surreal atmosphere.

## Architectural Elements
The scene features **geometric, blocky structures** characteristic of voxel or low-poly art:
- **Large rectangular volumes** in varying heights and depths, suggesting buildings or abstract monoliths
- **Oversized cubic and rectangular forms** that create an almost Brutalist aesthetic
- **Layered depth** with structures receding into the distance, implying a vast environment
- **Clean, faceted surfaces** with minimal detail, emphasizing form over texture

## Spatial Composition
- A **ground plane** rendered in muted purple and teal gradients
- **Elevated platforms and pathways** suggesting navigable space
- **Multiple planes of depth** that create a sense of expansive, otherworldly architecture
- **Asymmetrical balance** with structures distributed across the scene

## Lighting & Color
- **Soft, diffuse lighting** with subtle shadow definition
- **Color blocking** rather than realistic lighting—distinct pastel hues on different surfaces
- **Cool color dominance**: blues, purples, teals, grays, and beiges
- **Minimal contrast**, creating a calm, meditative mood

## UI Overlay
White text displays game controls:
- **Move: WASD**
- **Jump: SPACE**
- **Look: MOUSE**

This indicates an **interactive first-person experience**, likely a game or immersive exploration environment.
