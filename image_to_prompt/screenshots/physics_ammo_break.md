# Three.js Scene Description

This is a minimalist 3D architectural visualization rendered in Three.js, featuring the following elements:

## Environment
- **Background**: Soft light blue sky gradient
- **Ground**: White gridded plane with perspective grid lines receding into the distance, providing spatial reference and depth

## Main Structures

### Red Rectangular Frame
- Two tall **red/dark crimson vertical pillars** positioned on the left and right sides
- A **muted olive-green horizontal beam** spanning across the top, connecting the two pillars
- Creates a gateway or portal-like architectural frame
- Appears to be the primary focal point and spatial anchor

### Central Castle/Tower Structure
- **Red cone** positioned at the apex, resembling a castle or tower roof
- **Gray vertical cylindrical segments** (pillars or walls) arranged in a row beneath the cone
- Creates a simplified castle or fortified structure aesthetic
- Positioned directly within/through the red frame gateway

## Lighting & Rendering
- Soft, even lighting with subtle shadows
- Clean, geometric style prioritizing form over texture
- Minimal material complexity with solid colors
- The perspective suggests a three-quarter view for optimal visibility

## Overall Aesthetic
The composition evokes a playful, architectural toy-like quality—possibly representing a gateway to a castle or fortress. The stark simplicity and geometric forms suggest this might be a demonstration or tutorial scene for 3D modeling fundamentals.
