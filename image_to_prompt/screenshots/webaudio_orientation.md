# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist 3D visualization rendered in three.js featuring a geometric demonstration of camera frustum or light projection mechanics. The scene uses a clean, professional aesthetic with neutral gray lighting.

## Key Elements

### Central Object
- A small **black spherical element** positioned at the origin, serving as the focal point
- This appears to represent a camera or light source

### Projection Visualization
- A **green wireframe cone/pyramid** extending downward and outward from the sphere, rendered with thin green lines
- The cone displays multiple radial lines emanating from the center, creating a fan-like pattern
- This structure typically represents the field of view (FOV) of a camera or the spread of directional light

### Plane/Surface
- A **coral/salmon-pink rectangular plane** positioned in the upper portion of the scene
- Appears to be a flat surface positioned to intersect with or be illuminated by the projection

### Additional Elements
- A **yellow/lime rectangular outline** visible on the right side, possibly indicating another plane or boundary

## Lighting & Rendering
- Soft, ambient gray lighting creates a neutral, technical appearance
- No harsh shadows, suggesting diffuse illumination
- The scene has a professional, diagram-like quality typical of educational or technical visualizations

## Purpose
This visualization likely demonstrates camera frustum geometry, light projection, or viewport culling in 3D graphics—common concepts in three.js tutorials and 3D graphics education.
