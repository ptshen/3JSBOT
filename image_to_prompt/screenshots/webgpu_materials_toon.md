# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist, aesthetically refined 3D visualization featuring a symmetrical arrangement of spheres against a deep purple gradient background. The scene demonstrates excellent use of color theory and spatial organization.

## Central Element: Sphere Grid
The composition is dominated by a **5×6 grid of spheres** arranged in vertical columns, creating a structured, modular appearance:

- **Left Column**: Muted coral/salmon pink tones
- **Second Column**: Warm peachy-beige hues
- **Center-Left Column**: Soft sage/muted green
- **Center-Right Column**: Cool mint/seafoam green  
- **Right-Center Column**: Soft lavender/mauve purple
- **Far Right Column**: Dusty rose/mauve pink

## Lighting & Material Properties
- **Soft, diffused lighting** creates gentle shadows and depth perception
- **Matte or semi-glossy materials** with subtle highlights suggesting 3D volume
- **No harsh shadows**, maintaining the clean, modern aesthetic
- Spheres appear to have slight depth variations, adding subtle dimensionality

## Text Elements
- **"gradient"** label appears on the left side
- **"gradientMap"** label appears on the right side
- Clean, minimal typography in light gray

## Color Palette & Mood
The scene employs a **pastel, desaturated palette** with a sophisticated, modern feel. The deep periwinkle-purple background creates elegant contrast against the softer sphere tones, suggesting this may be demonstrating color gradients or mapping techniques in three.js.

## Technical Observations
- Demonstrates advanced material and lighting techniques
- Perfect example of parametric design or data visualization
- Professional presentation style suitable for documentation or portfolio work
