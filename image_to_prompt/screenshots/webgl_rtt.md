# 3D Scene Description: Pan-African Flag Pie Charts

## Overall Composition
A meticulously arranged grid of three-dimensional pie charts displaying the Pan-African flag colors, rendered with professional three.js visualization techniques. The scene features approximately 15 visible pie chart objects arranged in a 5×3 matrix pattern.

## Pie Chart Design
Each pie chart is a 3D cylindrical form with:
- **Four equal segments** representing the Pan-African colors:
  - **Red** (upper left)
  - **Yellow/Gold** (upper right)
  - **Green** (lower right)
  - **Black** (lower left)
- **Cream/tan colored edge rings** providing dimensional definition and visual separation between segments
- **Smooth shading** with subtle gradients creating depth perception

## Lighting & Materials
- **Directional lighting** creating realistic shadows and dimension
- **Specular highlights** on the top surfaces of each chart
- **Matte finish** on segment surfaces with strategic glossiness on edges
- **Soft shadow casting** on the background plane

## Background
- **Alternating color pattern**: Yellow and deep maroon/burgundy stripes
- **Horizontal striping** creates a rhythmic visual pattern that complements the chart arrangement
- **Flat plane** providing stable ground for the 3D objects

## Camera & Perspective
- **Isometric-adjacent view** allowing clear visibility of pie chart segments
- **Slight downward angle** showcasing the dimensional depth of each chart
- **Uniform spacing** between objects with consistent scale

## Overall Aesthetic
Professional, data visualization-focused design with cultural symbolism, rendered with high-quality three.js shaders and geometry manipulation.
