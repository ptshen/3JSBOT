# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a striking minimalist 3D scene featuring a geometric, nested square composition with a bold color palette of gold, deep blue, and teal against a black void.

## Primary Elements

### Outer Frame
- A large golden/amber-colored square frame with a textured, grid-like surface
- The texture appears to be composed of small cubic or voxel-like elements, creating a subtle relief pattern
- Serves as a border with precise geometric edges

### Inner Border
- A dark navy blue frame sitting between the outer golden border and central content
- Provides a clean separation and visual break between layers
- Creates depth through the layering system

### Central Content
- A dense field of small spheres or particles in varying shades of deep blue and cyan/teal
- The particles appear to be randomly distributed, creating an organic, cloud-like texture
- The color variation gives the particles dimension and visual interest
- Fills the entire inner square area completely

## Visual Effects & Atmosphere
- **Lighting**: Subtle ambient lighting that highlights the texture of the golden frame while keeping the interior relatively evenly lit
- **Color Contrast**: Strong chromatic contrast between warm gold, cool blues, and the absolute black background
- **Depth Perception**: Clear layering creates convincing 3D depth despite the geometric simplicity
- **Style**: Modern, contemporary aesthetic—part data visualization, part abstract art

## Technical Observations
- Clean geometry with sharp edges and precise angles
- Particle system rendered efficiently in the center
- Likely using basic geometries (BoxGeometry, SphereGeometry) and standard materials
