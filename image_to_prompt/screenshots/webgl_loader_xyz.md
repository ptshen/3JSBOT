# 3D Scene Description

This is a minimalist three.js rendered scene featuring:

## Composition
- **Background**: Solid black void, creating high contrast and focus on the central objects
- **Lighting**: Subtle, dramatic lighting that emphasizes form and depth through strategic shadows

## Main Objects
Two prominent **toroidal (donut-shaped) 3D meshes** positioned in the center of the frame:
- **Left torus**: Slightly offset to the left, rendered in dark gray/charcoal with visible wireframe or geometric segments
- **Right torus**: Positioned to the right, similar styling with perceptible geometric construction lines

## Visual Style
- **Wireframe elements**: Both objects display visible geometric lattice/grid patterns, suggesting either partial wireframe rendering or low-poly mesh visualization
- **Material**: Matte, dark finish with minimal reflectivity
- **Shading**: Smooth Gouraud or Phong shading with subtle surface gradations

## Technical Aspects
- Clean, uncluttered composition typical of three.js educational/demonstration scenes
- Low polygon count with visible mesh structure
- Effective use of negative space (black background) to isolate subjects
- Possibly showcasing geometry manipulation, lighting techniques, or basic 3D object rendering

The scene has an abstract, technical quality—ideal for demonstrating 3D rendering capabilities or geometric mathematics visualization.
