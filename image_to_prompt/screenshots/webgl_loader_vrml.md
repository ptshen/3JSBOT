# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist, low-poly 3D rendered scene created in Three.js featuring a stylized rural landscape with architectural elements.

## Environment
- **Sky**: A soft cyan/turquoise gradient background occupying the upper half of the viewport
- **Terrain**: A gentle green plane forming the ground, with subtle color variation suggesting a slight slope or elevation change from the middle to the foreground
- **Lighting**: Ambient, diffuse lighting that creates soft shadows and gives the scene a peaceful, overcast quality

## Main Objects

### Primary Building (Left)
- A charming red/rust-colored cottage or farmhouse with a distinctive steep gabled roof
- **Roof**: Dark slate gray with a peaked triangular profile
- **Walls**: Burnt red/terracotta colored walls with visible door and window openings (cream/beige colored)
- **Style**: Traditional architectural design with clean, geometric forms
- **Scale**: Dominates the left side of the composition

### Secondary Structure (Right)
- A smaller red utility building or shed, positioned to the right and further back
- Similar rust-red coloring to match the main house
- Simpler, more cubic form with minimal architectural detail
- Appears to be an outbuilding or storage structure

## Artistic Style
The scene employs a **low-poly aesthetic** with flat colors, minimal texture detail, and simplified geometry—characteristic of Three.js demonstration work or stylized game graphics.
