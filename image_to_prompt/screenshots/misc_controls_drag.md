# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a vibrant, abstract three-dimensional composition rendered in Three.js featuring a dynamic cluster of colorful cubic and rectangular forms scattered across the scene. The arrangement creates an explosion-like or chaotic assemblage of geometric solids against a neutral light gray background.

## Visual Elements

**Color Palette:**
The scene employs a rich, saturated spectrum including:
- Bright lime and neon greens
- Deep magentas and hot pinks
- Royal and electric blues
- Rich purples and violets
- Warm oranges, golds, and ochres
- Deep maroons and burgundies
- Cyan and turquoise accents
- White highlights
- Olive and moss greens

**Geometry:**
- Predominantly cube-based shapes of varying sizes
- Mix of perfect cubes and rectangular prisms
- Organic, non-uniform spatial distribution
- Forms appear to radiate outward from a central point

## Lighting & Rendering

**Illumination:**
- Multi-directional lighting creating distinct shadows on each form
- Soft ambient lighting providing overall scene visibility
- Specular highlights suggesting matte to semi-glossy material finishes
- Realistic shadow casting beneath and between blocks

**Depth & Perspective:**
- Isometric-style viewing angle
- Strong sense of three-dimensionality with visible depth
- Clear foreground, midground, and background layers
- Blocks at varying distances from the camera

## Artistic Effect
The composition evokes a sense of energetic chaos, explosion, or digital abstraction—perhaps representing data visualization, digital art, or pure creative expression. The random arrangement combined with the vivid color scheme creates visual interest and movement.
