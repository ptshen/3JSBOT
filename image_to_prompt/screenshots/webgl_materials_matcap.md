# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a professional 3D bust sculpture rendered in Three.js, featuring a realistic human head and shoulders displayed against a pure black background. The stark contrast creates a gallery-like presentation typical of digital art showcases or 3D modeling portfolios.

## Geometry & Model Details
- **Head**: Anatomically proportioned male head with smooth, featureless facial characteristics
- **Features**: Minimal facial detail—neutral expression with defined but unmarked eyes, nose, and mouth
- **Shoulders**: Broad, well-defined shoulders and upper torso extending to approximately mid-chest
- **Surface**: Completely smooth, seamless geometry with no visible topology or polygonal artifacts

## Material & Shading
- **Finish**: Matte white/light gray material with soft, diffuse properties
- **Reflectivity**: Minimal specular highlights suggest a clay-like or matte plaster appearance
- **Subsurface Details**: Subtle shading variation across facial planes and musculature, creating dimensionality without harsh shadows

## Lighting
- **Key Light**: Single soft directional light source positioned anteriorly and slightly above, creating gentle modeling across the face
- **Shadow**: Soft shadows beneath the chin and around the neck area provide depth
- **No ambient occlusion**: Clean presentation without corner darkening

## Artistic Style
This renders as a classical sculptural study—reminiscent of museum busts or foundational 3D character modeling. Perfect for educational purposes, character design reference, or digital sculpture demonstration.
