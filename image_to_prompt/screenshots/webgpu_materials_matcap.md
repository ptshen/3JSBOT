# 3D Scene Description: Anatomical Head Model

## Overall Composition
This is a professional anatomical bust sculpture rendered in three.js, featuring a neutral, frontally-oriented male human head. The piece demonstrates high-quality 3D modeling and rendering techniques typical of medical, educational, or character design applications.

## Lighting & Materials
- **Lighting Setup**: Sophisticated three-point lighting system with:
  - Key light positioned to the upper left, creating subtle facial modeling
  - Fill light preventing harsh shadows on the shadowed side
  - Rim/back lighting subtly defining the form's silhouette
- **Material Properties**: Smooth, matte skin shader with realistic subsurface scattering, giving the model organic, lifelike qualities
- **Surface Detail**: Refined surface topology showing natural skin texture without excessive detail, maintaining a clinical/neutral appearance

## Geometric Features
- **Head Form**: Anatomically accurate cranial structure with proper proportions
- **Facial Features**:
  - Neutral expression with relaxed musculature
  - Well-defined cheekbones and jaw structure
  - Proportionate nose, ears, and facial symmetry
  - Closed, calm expression
- **Shoulders**: Truncated bust format extending to mid-shoulder area for context and stability

## Background & Composition
- **Background**: Pure black (void/studio setting) ensuring maximum focus on the model
- **Perspective**: Dead-on frontal view, classic sculptural presentation
- **Rendering Quality**: High polygon count, smooth surface normals, and professional-grade mesh optimization

## Technical Execution
This exemplifies professional 3D character/anatomy modeling suitable for medical visualization, educational content, or digital sculpture portfolios.
