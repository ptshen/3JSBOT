# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
A beautifully rendered 3D scene featuring a sophisticated table lamp positioned in an urban plaza setting. The scene demonstrates advanced rendering techniques with realistic materials, lighting, and environmental mapping.

## Primary Object: The Lamp
- **Lampshade**: A truncated cone (frustum) with a rich chocolate-brown matte material
- **Base**: A perfectly spherical element with highly reflective, chrome-like properties
- **Light Source**: A warm, glowing bulb creating realistic illumination and reflections
- **Design**: Minimalist modern aesthetic with clean geometric forms

## Material Properties
- **Reflective Sphere**: Exhibits strong specular highlights and mirror-like reflections of the surrounding environment
- **Cloth Shade**: Diffuse matte finish that absorbs light naturally
- **Metal Elements**: Polished metallic surfaces with accurate Fresnel reflections

## Environmental Setting
- **Background Architecture**: Historic European-style buildings with terracotta/orange-red facades visible through the lampshade's transparent interior
- **Vegetation**: Mature trees with dense green foliage on the left side
- **Sky**: Soft blue gradient suggesting late afternoon or early evening lighting conditions
- **Ground Plane**: Flat plaza surface suggesting a public square or courtyard

## Lighting & Atmosphere
- **Global Illumination**: Warm, diffuse environmental lighting typical of golden hour photography
- **Reflections**: The spherical base acts as a mirror, reflecting the plaza, buildings, and sky
- **Caustics/Refraction**: Light passes through the transparent lamp base, creating subtle optical effects
- **Shadows**: Soft, natural shadow casting suggesting a specific light direction

## Technical Highlights
- Advanced physically-based rendering (PBR) materials
- Image-based lighting (IBL) creating realistic environmental reflections
- Depth of field or careful focal length selection emphasizing the lamp
- High-quality anti-aliasing and smooth surface normals

This scene exemplifies modern 3D visualization with photorealistic quality suitable for product design, architectural visualization, or artistic rendering.
