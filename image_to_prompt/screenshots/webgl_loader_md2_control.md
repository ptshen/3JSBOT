# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a stylized, minimalist 3D scene featuring a linear procession of identical character models arranged across a vibrant lime-green landscape against a clear sky.

## Environmental Elements
- **Ground Plane**: A seamless, bright lime-green terrain with subtle texture variations suggesting grass or moss, extending to the horizon
- **Sky**: Clear, empty white/light gray background occupying the upper portion of the frame
- **Lighting**: Appears to be natural, even illumination suggesting overcast daylight or a neutral key light setup
- **Perspective**: Low camera angle positioned at approximately ground level, creating a dramatic, worm's-eye view that emphasizes the row of characters

## Character Models
- **Count**: Approximately 12-13 identical figures
- **Design**: Brown/bronze-colored humanoid characters with a robust, squat silhouette
- **Style**: Low-poly or simplified geometric design with minimal detail
- **Posture**: Appears to be in a neutral standing pose, evenly spaced
- **Variation**: One or two characters feature a distinctly different red/crimson coloration among the predominantly brown figures, creating a focal point

## Artistic Intent
This composition suggests themes of:
- Uniformity versus individuality (the red figure breaking the pattern)
- Procession, pilgrimage, or army
- Minimalist game design or abstract narrative visualization

The scene has a somewhat surreal, possibly satirical quality typical of experimental three.js demonstrations.
