# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist 3D scene displaying a **split-screen dual monitor setup** rendered in three.js. The scene is divided into two equal rectangular sections by a vertical white line, representing a display configuration commonly used in professional workstations.

## Visual Elements

### Background
- **Dominant Color**: Bright, saturated red (#FF0000) fills the entire viewport
- **Uniform Lighting**: Flat, even illumination suggests basic ambient lighting with no complex shadows or shading

### Central Divider
- A **vertical white line** runs from top to bottom, centered on the screen
- This represents the physical bezel or gap between two display monitors
- Creates a clear visual separation between the left and right display areas

### UI Elements/Text Labels
- **Left Side**: Small white text reading "sRGB" positioned in the upper-left corner
  - Likely indicates the color space being used (Standard Red Green Blue)
  
- **Right Side**: Small white text reading "Display P3" positioned in the upper-right corner
  - Indicates an alternative wide-gamut color space (Display P3)

## Technical Implications
This scene appears to be a **color space comparison tool** or **display calibration visualization**, demonstrating the difference between sRGB and Display P3 color rendering across a dual-monitor setup. The monochromatic red serves as a test color to evaluate color accuracy and gamut differences between the two color standards.
