# 3D Checkerboard Scene Analysis

## Overall Composition
This is a cleanly rendered 3D checkerboard displayed in an isometric-like perspective against a black background. The board appears to be a standard 8x8 chess configuration.

## Material and Texture Properties

**Board Squares:**
- **Light squares**: Off-white/light gray with a subtle matte finish and visible micro-texture creating a worn, fabric-like appearance
- **Dark squares**: Medium to dark gray with similar surface texture and weathering
- Both square types display realistic **normal mapping** that creates surface irregularities and subtle shadows, suggesting age or worn material

**Surface Finish:**
- Non-reflective matte material (likely basic Lambert or standard material in three.js)
- Minimal specular highlights
- The texture gives the impression of worn stone or aged fabric rather than polished marble

## Lighting Setup

- **Soft, diffuse lighting** from above-left position
- Multiple light sources appear to be used to illuminate the board evenly while maintaining depth perception
- **Subtle shadow variation** across squares creates dimensional depth
- No harsh shadows, suggesting ambient lighting contribution

## Perspective and Positioning

- Isometric or slight three-point perspective view
- Camera positioned to show the board at an approachable angle
- Board sits centered in frame with ample negative space

## Technical Quality

- Clean geometry with crisp edge definition between squares
- Well-optimized three.js scene with clear rendering
- Professional material workflow implementation
