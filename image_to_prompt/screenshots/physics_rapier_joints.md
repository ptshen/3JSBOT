# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist 3D scene rendered in Three.js against a soft, light blue gradient background. The scene features a simple but elegantly rendered mechanical or decorative object positioned in the upper-left portion of the frame.

## Primary Object: Stylized Lever or Seesaw
The main element consists of two distinct components:

### Red Sphere (Left End)
- A glossy red sphere with realistic lighting and reflections
- Positioned at the left terminus of the horizontal arm
- Material exhibits specular highlights, suggesting a polished or metallic finish
- Appears to be the pivot point or counterweight of the mechanism

### Golden/Brass Rod (Right Section)
- An elongated cylindrical shaft extending horizontally to the right
- Rich golden or brushed brass coloration with metallic properties
- The surface displays subtle segmentation or ridging along its length, suggesting either:
  - A ribbed or fluted mechanical design
  - Cylindrical segments stacked together
- Has warm, diffuse lighting that enhances its metallic appearance

## Lighting & Rendering
- Soft, ambient lighting throughout the scene
- Subtle shadows and highlights on both objects suggest three-point or area lighting
- The background uses a gentle light blue tone, creating a calm, professional atmosphere
- Material rendering demonstrates quality reflectivity appropriate for metallic surfaces

## Artistic Style
The scene embodies a clean, minimalist aesthetic typical of high-quality 3D product visualization or abstract mechanical art.
