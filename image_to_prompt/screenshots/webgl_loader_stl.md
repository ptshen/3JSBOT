# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a carefully arranged still life composition rendered in three.js, featuring three distinct geometric objects positioned on a neutral sand-colored ground plane against a warm taupe background.

## Objects

### Left: Coral Torus
- A peachy-coral colored torus (donut shape) with smooth, matte material
- Positioned on the left side of the composition
- Casts a subtle shadow on the ground plane
- The warm tone complements the overall color palette

### Center: Purple Cylinder with Orange Sphere
- A vibrant purple/violet cylindrical form serving as the central focal point
- Topped with a glossy, bright orange sphere that appears reflective
- The sphere sits directly on the cylinder's top surface
- This vertical stack creates height variation in the composition
- The color contrast between purple and orange is visually striking

### Right: Stacked Containers
- Three rectangular/cubic forms stacked in ascending height
- Rendered in cream, beige, and tan tones
- Appears to represent storage boxes or containers
- Lighter tones suggest metallic or brushed surfaces
- Creates a sense of depth through the stacking arrangement

## Lighting & Atmosphere
- Soft, diffused lighting that minimizes harsh shadows
- Warm color temperature overall with the beige-brown background
- Subtle shadows ground each object to the plane
- Professional product visualization style typical of modern 3D rendering
