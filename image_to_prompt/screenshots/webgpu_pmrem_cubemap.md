# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a meticulously organized grid of 30 spheres arranged in 5 rows and 6 columns, displaying a systematic progression of material properties and lighting responses against a warm, neutral beige background.

## Material Progression
The spheres demonstrate a sophisticated gradient of surface properties from left to right:

- **Left columns (1-2)**: Highly reflective, metallic spheres with pronounced specular highlights and mirror-like reflections of the environment
- **Middle columns (3-4)**: Transitional spheres showing a blend of metallic and matte characteristics
- **Right columns (5-6)**: Completely matte, diffuse white spheres with minimal specular reflection and soft lighting

## Lighting & Shading
- **Key light source**: Positioned from the upper left, creating bright highlights on metallic spheres
- **Reflections**: Clear environmental reflections visible on the polished surfaces
- **Soft shadows**: Subtle ambient occlusion and shadowing beneath each sphere, grounding them to the plane
- **Gradient falloff**: Smooth lighting transitions across the spherical surfaces

## Technical Quality
- **Geometry**: Perfect sphere primitives with adequate polygon density for smooth curvature
- **Material rendering**: Demonstrates proper roughness/metallic parameter interpolation
- **Depth & Spacing**: Uniform spacing and consistent sizing creates visual harmony
- **Camera angle**: Slightly elevated orthographic or wide perspective view

This appears to be a **material demonstration scene** or **roughness shader showcase** commonly used to test PBR (Physically Based Rendering) workflows in Three.js.
