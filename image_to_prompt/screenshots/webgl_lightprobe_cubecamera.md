# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a serene urban courtyard scene rendered in Three.js, featuring minimalist architecture and controlled lighting that creates a contemplative atmosphere.

## Key Elements

### Central Object
- **Large white sphere**: A perfectly smooth, matte white sphere dominates the center of the composition, positioned in the middle ground of the courtyard. It appears to be a simple geometric primitive with subtle soft shading, suggesting a soft-body material without significant specularity.

### Environment
- **Courtyard setting**: The scene is enclosed by multi-story residential or institutional buildings with warm, ochre/tan-colored facades
- **Architectural details**: 
  - Rectangular windows arranged in a grid pattern on the left building
  - Modernist vertical elements and building edges creating geometric composition
  - Ground-level concrete or stone flooring

### Lighting
- **Golden hour illumination**: The entire scene is bathed in warm, directional sunlight characteristic of late afternoon or early morning
- **Shadow casting**: Strong shadows from the buildings create depth and define the courtyard space
- **Clear sky**: A bright, cloudless blue sky visible above, creating strong contrast with the warm building tones

### Atmosphere
- **Clean aesthetic**: Minimalist, almost surreal quality with the perfectly rendered sphere
- **High detail rendering**: Sharp focus on the sphere with proper depth-of-field effects on the background buildings
- **Color palette**: Warm earth tones contrasted against cool blue sky, with the neutral white sphere as a focal point

This appears to be a study in geometric simplicity and lighting within an architectural context.
