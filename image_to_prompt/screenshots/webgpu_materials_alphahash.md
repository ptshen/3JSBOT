# 3D Scene Description: Spherical Particle Cluster

## Overall Composition
This is a three.js visualization featuring a dense, organic cluster of approximately 30-40 spheres arranged in a roughly cubic or tetrahedral formation against a pure black background. The spheres are positioned to create a cohesive, sculptural mass that appears to float in three-dimensional space.

## Lighting and Materials
- **Lighting Setup**: The scene employs strategic three-point or multi-directional lighting that creates soft, gradient shading across each sphere's surface
- **Material Properties**: Each sphere uses a textured, slightly grainy surface material (likely using normal maps or noise textures) that gives them a tactile, organic quality rather than perfect polish
- **Shadows**: Subtle ambient occlusion or soft shadows are visible where spheres overlap or rest against each other, enhancing depth perception

## Color Palette
The spheres display a vibrant spectrum including:
- Bright yellows and lime greens
- Magentas and hot pinks
- Cyan and turquoise blues
- Soft whites and light grays
- Deep navy and cobalt blues
- Peachy and coral tones

Colors are distributed somewhat randomly, creating visual interest and making it easy to distinguish individual spheres within the cluster.

## Depth and Perspective
The arrangement shows clear spatial dimensionality with foreground, middle-ground, and background spheres, creating a compelling sense of volume and three-dimensional presence. The slight transparency or bloom effects on some spheres suggest advanced rendering techniques.
