# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a striking **dark, minimalist 3D scene** dominated by a deep black background with strategically placed **glowing red/orange spheres** arranged in a hierarchical composition. The lighting design creates a dramatic, almost ominous atmosphere.

## Key Elements

### Primary Structure
- **Central Large Sphere**: A prominent glowing orb positioned in the upper-center area, serving as the focal point with intense red luminescence
- **Secondary Spheres**: Three smaller glowing orbs positioned around the central sphere, creating a clustered formation
- **Smallest Sphere**: Additional tiny glowing element (lower left), creating visual depth and hierarchy

### Lighting & Material Properties
- **Emissive Red Material**: All spheres appear to use an emissive red/orange shader, self-illuminating against the black void
- **Global Illumination**: Subtle environmental lighting reveals spherical geometry and creates gentle gradients across surfaces
- **Bloom/Glow Effect**: Clear post-processing with bloom, creating halos and light bleeding around each sphere
- **High Contrast**: The pitch-black background maximizes the visual impact of the glowing elements

### Technical Observations
- **Rendering Quality**: Smooth geometry suggests adequate polygon density
- **Perspective**: Camera positioned to frame all spheres within view with appropriate spacing
- **Depth Staging**: Overlapping and size variation create clear spatial hierarchy and depth perception

## Aesthetic & Mood
The scene evokes a **sci-fi, molecular, or cosmic theme**—reminiscent of atomic structures, distant planets, or data visualization. The ominous red glow and darkness suggest danger, energy, or otherworldly phenomena.
