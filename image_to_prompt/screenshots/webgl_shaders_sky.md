# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a serene, minimalist seascape rendered in Three.js featuring a perfect horizontal division between sky and water. The scene employs a soft, pastel color palette dominated by cool purples, mauves, and pale blues.

## Sky
- **Upper portion**: Gradient transitions from a pale gray-blue at the top to warmer peachy-pink tones toward the horizon
- **Lighting**: Soft, diffused light suggests either sunrise or sunset with overcast conditions
- **Sun**: A subtle, luminous orb sits precisely on the horizon line, rendered with minimal contrast against the sky
- **Atmospheric effect**: The sky has a hazy, atmospheric quality with no visible clouds—just smooth color gradation

## Water
- **Surface**: Perfectly flat, mirror-like plane creating a calm ocean surface
- **Reflection**: The water reflects the sky's coloring, showing muted purples and soft blues
- **Horizon line**: A thin horizontal accent line marks the meeting point between sea and sky, adding subtle definition

## Artistic Qualities
- **Minimalism**: Extremely simplified geometry with no objects, waves, or environmental details
- **Color Palette**: Monochromatic cool tones with warm peachy accents at the horizon
- **Mood**: Tranquil, meditative, contemplative
- **Lighting**: Single directional or ambient light creating soft, shadowless illumination
- **Perspective**: Centered, frontal viewpoint with perfect symmetry along the horizon

This appears to be a study in simplicity and atmospheric rendering, ideal for meditative or ambient applications.
