# 3D Scene Description

This three.js visualization displays a dynamic, abstract composition of **randomly oriented rectangular blocks or cubes** scattered throughout 3D space. Here are the key characteristics:

## Visual Elements

**Color Palette:**
- Vibrant **lime green** (#00FF00 or similar bright green)
- Bright **red** (#FF0000)
- These two colors create a high-contrast, eye-catching composition against the white background

**Geometry:**
- Multiple **elongated rectangular prisms** (cuboids) of varying sizes
- Blocks are rotated at seemingly random angles along all three axes (X, Y, Z)
- Objects appear to be distributed throughout a central volumetric space

**Spatial Composition:**
- Objects radiate outward from an approximate center point
- Some blocks overlap or cluster together, while others are more isolated
- The arrangement suggests either:
  - A particle system or exploding geometry effect
  - A generative/procedural art piece
  - A visualization of data or algorithmic patterns

## Lighting & Rendering
- Flat white background
- Basic ambient or uniform lighting (no dramatic shadows visible)
- Clean, geometric rendering typical of three.js WebGL output
- Objects have solid, uniform colors with minimal texture

## Overall Impression
This appears to be a **kinetic or generative art piece** emphasizing geometric abstraction, with a modern, energetic aesthetic created through strategic use of complementary colors and dynamic spatial arrangement.
