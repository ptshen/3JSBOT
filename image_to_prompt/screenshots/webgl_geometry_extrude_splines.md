# 3D Scene Description: Interlocking Torus Knot

## Overview
This is a minimalist 3D visualization featuring a mathematical object rendered in three.js against a neutral light gray background.

## Primary Geometry
The main element is a **torus knot** – a sophisticated topological structure that weaves through itself in a continuous, non-self-intersecting path. The geometry creates an elegant figure-eight or infinity-like pattern when viewed from the front.

## Visual Properties
- **Color**: Vibrant magenta/fuchsia purple with high saturation
- **Material**: Appears to be a solid, matte material with clean edges
- **Stroke Width**: The knot has a consistent tubular cross-section with moderate thickness
- **Lighting**: Subtle directional lighting creates minimal shadowing, giving the object a clean, rendered appearance with slight depth perception

## Composition
- **Positioning**: Centered in the frame
- **Orientation**: The knot is positioned to display its characteristic interwoven structure most effectively
- **Scale**: The object occupies roughly the central third of the canvas
- **Background**: Plain, light gray with no additional elements, allowing complete focus on the geometry

## Technical Notes
The rendering demonstrates smooth geometry with refined tesselation, typical of three.js parametric surface generation. The design represents the mathematical concept of a **(2,3)-torus knot**, commonly used in scientific visualization and abstract digital art.
