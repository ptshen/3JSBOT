# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a meticulously rendered 3D scene featuring four spheres of varying materials and finishes, arranged in a 2x2 grid formation against an architectural background. The lighting setup creates a warm, golden hour atmosphere with realistic shadows and reflections.

## Individual Elements

### Spheres

1. **Blue Sphere (Top Left)**
   - Highly polished, mirror-like finish
   - Deep, saturated cobalt blue color
   - Perfect specular reflections from the environment
   - Smooth, glossy material with minimal roughness

2. **Black Sphere (Top Right)**
   - Textured, ribbed/grooved surface pattern
   - Matte to semi-gloss finish
   - Subtle environmental reflections
   - Appears to have a radial ridge pattern, possibly suggesting a technical or industrial aesthetic

3. **White Sphere (Bottom Left)**
   - Dimpled surface texture (golf ball-like pattern)
   - Bright white matte finish
   - Diffuse reflections across the surface
   - Well-defined shadow details highlighting the dimple topology

4. **Red Sphere (Bottom Right)**
   - Glossy, polished finish
   - Vibrant, saturated red color
   - Strong specular highlights and reflections
   - Smooth, reflective surface comparable to the blue sphere

## Environment & Lighting
- Warm, golden-hour directional lighting
- Soft shadows cast beneath each sphere
- Blurred architectural background (hallway/corridor setting)
- Professional depth-of-field effect focusing on the spheres
- Subtle color grading with warm tones

This scene effectively demonstrates advanced material properties and lighting techniques in three.js.
