# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a striking split-screen composition showcasing a stylized 3D torus knot rendered in two distinctly different visualization styles, creating a compelling before-and-after or technical vs. artistic contrast.

## Left Half: Wood/Natural Material
- **Geometry**: A twisted torus knot with organic, rope-like qualities
- **Material**: Realistic wood texture with warm, golden-tan coloring
- **Surface Details**: 
  - Natural wood grain patterns and striations
  - Weathered appearance with subtle variations in tone
  - Matte finish suggesting aged or natural wood
- **Lighting**: Warm, diffuse illumination revealing surface topology
- **Aesthetic**: Traditional, earthy, and tactile

## Right Half: Neon/Digital Material
- **Geometry**: Identical torus knot geometry for comparison
- **Material**: Vibrant, luminous gradient
- **Color Palette**:
  - Vivid cyan/turquoise
  - Hot magenta/pink
  - Deep blue and violet
  - Rainbow-spectrum transitions
- **Surface Properties**: 
  - Emissive, glowing material
  - Glossy, reflective appearance
  - High saturation and contrast
- **Aesthetic**: Contemporary, digital, cyber-inspired

## Technical Aspects
- **Background**: Split 50/50 between dark gray (left) and pure black (right)
- **Lighting**: High contrast, emphasizing material differences rather than form
- **Rendering**: Smooth geometry with clean topology
- **Purpose**: Material/shader showcase demonstrating three.js capabilities
