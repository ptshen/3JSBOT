# 3D Medical Brain Scan Visualization

## Scene Description

This is a sophisticated **sagittal (side-view) cross-section of the human brain** rendered in three.js with professional medical imaging aesthetics.

### Key Visual Elements:

**Anatomical Details:**
- The image displays a **midsagittal plane** (median vertical slice) of the entire head and brain
- Visible structures include the cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem, and spinal cord
- Clear depiction of internal brain architecture with subtle gray matter gradations
- Facial skeleton profile (nose, jaw, teeth structure) visible in the anterior portion

**Rendering Style:**
- **Grayscale/monochromatic color scheme** mimicking MRI or CT scan appearance
- **High-contrast lighting** with dark background (pure black) creating dramatic separation
- **Smooth surface rendering** suggesting volumetric medical scan data
- Subtle gradient shading that emphasizes anatomical depth and dimensionality

**Technical Presentation:**
- Professional medical imaging quality
- Volumetric rendering that appears to be derived from actual scan data
- Clean, clinical presentation suitable for educational or diagnostic purposes
- The three-dimensional geometry is well-optimized for interactive viewing

**Overall Purpose:**
This appears to be an interactive medical visualization tool, ideal for anatomical education, clinical reference, or patient communication in a healthcare setting.
