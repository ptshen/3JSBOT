# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist, abstract 3D scene rendered in Three.js featuring a clean, monochromatic aesthetic dominated by soft grays and whites.

## Key Elements

### Central Structure
- A prominent **vertical crevasse or canyon** runs down the center of the composition, appearing as a deep, dark shadow line
- The crevasse creates a strong focal point, drawing the viewer's eye downward with dramatic depth

### Surface Geometry
- Two large, smooth **curved or undulating planes** rise up on either side of the central divide
- The surfaces appear to be highly polished or reflective, suggesting **procedurally-generated terrain** or abstract geometric forms
- The planes feature subtle **gradients and lighting variations**, creating an illusion of depth and volume

### Lighting
- **Soft, diffuse illumination** - likely from a key light positioned above
- A warm highlight visible in the upper left corner suggests **hemisphere lighting** or environment mapping
- **Subsurface scattering effects** may be present, giving the surfaces an organic, translucent quality
- Shadows within the crevasse create dramatic contrast against the bright, neutral surfaces

## Atmosphere
- The scene evokes a sense of **vast geological scale** - reminiscent of aerial photography of canyons or mountain valleys
- **Minimal color palette** (whites, grays, warm creams) creates a serene, contemplative mood
- The abstract nature allows for multiple interpretations - could represent terrain, fabric, marble, or purely digital abstraction

This is characteristic of **contemporary digital art** utilizing Three.js for creating atmospheric, sculptural visualizations.
