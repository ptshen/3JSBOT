# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a three-dimensional interior space rendered in Three.js, depicting a simple geometric room or corridor viewed from a first-person perspective standing on the floor.

## Structural Elements

**Walls:**
- **Left Wall**: Bright red plane extending from the foreground into the distance
- **Right Wall**: Vibrant lime green plane mirroring the left wall's geometry
- **Back Wall**: Soft periwinkle/lavender blue plane closing off the rear of the space
- **Floor**: Light gray/white plane serving as the ground plane

## Lighting & Atmosphere
- Ambient lighting creates a clean, evenly-lit environment with minimal shadows
- The materials appear to be matte or semi-matte with subtle shading that gives dimensional depth
- Soft highlights are visible on the back wall, suggesting a light source positioned above and slightly forward

## Spatial Characteristics
- The perspective creates a strong sense of linear depth, with walls converging toward the vanishing point at the rear
- The space appears to be a rectangular corridor or tunnel-like chamber
- Dimensions suggest a relatively narrow, confined passage

## Technical Observations
- Clean geometry with precise plane intersections
- Professional color choice for contrast and visual clarity
- Simple but effective demonstration of Three.js's 3D rendering capabilities
- The scene appears to be a basic architectural or game engine visualization

This type of scene is commonly used for testing 3D rendering pipelines, demonstrating perspective, or as a foundation for game environments.
