# 3D Scene Description: Cozy Isometric Room

## Overall Aesthetic
This is a charming, low-poly isometric interior space with a warm, stylized appearance reminiscent of indie game environments or mobile game art. The scene features a vibrant, cheerful color palette dominated by golden-brown wood tones, complemented by teal accents and bright decorative elements.

## Architectural Elements
