# Three.js Scene Description: Subgroup Reduction Explanation

## Scene Overview
This is a minimalist, dark-themed educational visualization designed to demonstrate the concept of subgroup reduction in three.js. The scene features a predominantly **black background** with a clean, professional presentation style.

## Visual Elements

### Text & UI
- **Header Text**: "Subgroup Reduction Explanation" displayed in white, centered typography
- **Descriptive Text**: Below the header reads: "Use subgroupsAs() to capture reduction of each workgroup's subgroups (Hover for animation)"
- **Visual Style**: Clean, sans-serif font with high contrast against the dark background

## Design Characteristics

- **Color Palette**: Monochromatic with black background and white text
- **Composition**: Centered, minimalist layout focusing on clarity
- **Purpose**: Educational/Technical demonstration of WebGPU or compute shader concepts
- **Interactivity**: Hints at hover-based animation triggers for exploring subgroup behavior
- **Tone**: Professional, technical, suitable for developer documentation or educational materials

## Technical Context
The scene appears to be part of a tutorial or documentation set explaining GPU compute concepts, specifically how subgroup reduction operations work in parallel computing contexts. The emphasis on hover interaction suggests this is part of an interactive learning tool.
