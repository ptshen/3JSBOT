# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a three.js rendered scene featuring three distinct geometric objects arranged horizontally across a dark black background, each illuminated by colored lighting that creates dramatic contrasts and shadows.

## Left Object - Red/Crimson Form
A rounded, organic polyhedron with a deep red and maroon color palette. The object appears to be an icosphere or similar geometric primitive with numerous facets. It's lit predominantly from the front with warm red tones, creating strong highlights on the upper surface while the lower portions fade into darker shadows. The lighting suggests a point light source positioned above and slightly in front of the object.

## Center Object - Warm to Cool Gradient
A sculptural form displaying a striking color transition from warm golden-orange tones on the left side to cool blue-purple hues on the right side. This suggests dual lighting: a warm-colored light source (possibly yellow or orange) illuminating one side, and a cool blue light from the opposite direction. The object appears to be faceted and architectural, with an angular, modernist aesthetic. The contrast between the warm and cool lighting creates a visually striking effect.

## Right Object - Electric Blue Accent
A minimalist geometric form rendered primarily in bright cyan/electric blue, positioned against the black background with a small red or warm-colored accent point visible at its base. The object appears simpler and more angular than the others, possibly a stylized or abstract form.

## Lighting & Atmosphere
The scene employs high-contrast, colorful lighting typical of modern 3D visualization work—using complementary color temperatures and strategic point lights to create visual drama and depth against the unlit black environment.
