# 3D Scene Description

This is a minimalist three.js rendered scene featuring:

## Composition
- **Primary Subject**: A simplified red car model positioned in the center-foreground of the scene
- **Camera Perspective**: A slightly elevated, front-facing isometric or perspective view that creates depth

## Environment
- **Ground Plane**: An expansive light gray/white grid-based floor that extends toward the horizon, creating a strong sense of perspective and depth
- **Sky**: A soft, pale blue gradient backdrop that transitions subtly from slightly darker at the top to lighter near the horizon
- **Lighting**: Clean, neutral lighting with minimal shadows, suggesting either diffuse illumination or an overcast environment

## Visual Characteristics
- **Color Palette**: Cool, muted tones—the red car stands out as the only vibrant accent
- **Style**: Geometric and abstract with a minimalist aesthetic
- **Grid System**: The perspective grid on the floor emphasizes depth and mathematical precision, typical of CAD or automotive visualization software
- **Scale**: The vastness of the ground plane relative to the vehicle suggests either a spacious environment or a zoomed-out view

This type of scene is commonly used for product visualization, architectural rendering, or automotive design presentations.
