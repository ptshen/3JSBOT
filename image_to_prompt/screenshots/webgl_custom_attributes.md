# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist 3D scene featuring a single spherical object centered against a pure black background, creating a striking contrast and focus on the subject.

## Main Object - The Sphere
- **Shape**: Perfect sphere with high geometric resolution
- **Material**: Metallic/reflective surface with a matte-to-semi-glossy finish
- **Color**: Deep crimson red with subtle variations in tone
- **Surface Details**: 
  - Realistic surface imperfections and texture variations creating subtle shadowing
  - Darker areas concentrated around the edges and lower hemisphere, suggesting ambient occlusion
  - Slight weathered or brushed metal appearance with micro-surface irregularities
  - Gentle specular highlights suggesting a controlled light source

## Lighting Setup
- **Primary Light**: Appears to be positioned slightly above and to the left of the sphere
- **Illumination**: Creates natural shadowing on the sphere's surface
- **Ambient Light**: Minimal, allowing the sphere to maintain definition against the dark background
- **Shadow Type**: Soft, diffused shadows without harsh edges

## Environment
- **Background**: Solid black (likely `0x000000` in hex)
- **Atmosphere**: Clean, clinical presentation with no additional geometry or environment maps
- **Rendering Quality**: High polygon count sphere with smooth shading

## Overall Aesthetic
Professional, product-like presentation typical of material demonstration or 3D portfolio work, emphasizing realistic surface properties and lighting.
