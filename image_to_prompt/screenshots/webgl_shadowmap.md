# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a stylized 3D scene rendered in Three.js featuring large, bold red typography against a warm, neutral desert-like environment. The scene combines text, character models, and environmental elements in a playful, animated style.

## Key Elements

### Typography
- **Text**: "THREE.JS" rendered in large, extruded 3D letters with a glossy red material
- The letters appear to have beveled edges and cast subtle shadows on the ground plane
- The text serves as the dominant focal point of the composition

### Characters & Objects
- **Horse**: A brown horse model positioned in the center-foreground, appearing to be in mid-gallop or motion
- **Cowboy Figure**: A character model (appears to be a simplified humanoid) positioned near the top center of the scene, wielding what looks like a lasso or rope
- **Bird**: A small flying creature (possibly a pterodactyl or bird) in flight near the upper portion of the scene

### Environment
- **Ground Plane**: A flat, sandy/beige-colored surface with subtle texture variation and scattered small shadows
- **Lighting**: Warm, diffuse lighting creating long shadows and giving the scene a sunset or desert atmosphere
- **Color Palette**: Warm earth tones (sandy beige, brown) complemented by the vibrant red text

## Artistic Style
The scene evokes a Western/cowboy theme with humorous, low-poly character designs. The combination of typography branding with whimsical 3D characters creates an engaging, branded demonstration of Three.js capabilities.
