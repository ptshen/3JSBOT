# 3D Scene Description

## Overview
This is a vibrant, dynamic three.js visualization featuring an explosion or burst of colorful 3D geometric objects radiating outward from a central point against a clean white background.

## Primary Elements

**Geometric Forms:**
- Multiple cubes and rectangular prisms in varying sizes
- Spheres and rounded shapes of different scales
- The objects range from small to medium-sized, creating a sense of depth and hierarchy

**Color Palette:**
- **Primary colors:** Purple, magenta, and blue dominate the composition
- **Secondary colors:** Cyan, turquoise, and teal accents
- **Gradients:** Many objects feature iridescent or gradient effects transitioning between colors (purple-to-cyan, magenta-to-blue)
- The color scheme creates a cool, modern, tech-forward aesthetic

## Spatial Composition

**Distribution:**
- Objects are dispersed in a three-dimensional radial pattern, emanating from the center
- Density is highest toward the middle, tapering outward
- Creates a strong sense of motion and energy, suggesting an explosion or burst effect

**Depth:**
- Effective use of size variation and layering to convey depth
- Foreground, midground, and background elements are clearly distinguished
- Some objects appear closer (larger) while others recede (smaller)

## Lighting & Material Properties
- Smooth, reflective surfaces on many objects indicating metallic or polished materials
- Strong directional lighting creating visible highlights and shadows
- The glossy finish enhances the three-dimensional quality

## Overall Mood
Modern, energetic, and playful—suggesting innovation, technology, or creative dynamism.
