# Three.js Scene Description: Edge Split Modifier Visualization

## Overall Composition
This is a clean, professional 3D visualization of a revolver rendered in Three.js with a minimalist aesthetic. The scene features a monochromatic color scheme against a pure black background, emphasizing the geometric forms of the weapon model.

## Lighting & Rendering
- **Lighting Setup**: Strategic directional or key lighting from the upper left, creating subtle shadows and depth
- **Material Properties**: The revolver features a polished metallic finish with:
  - Bright specular highlights on the barrel and cylinder
  - Matte gray tones on the grip and frame
  - Realistic reflection properties suggesting a chrome or stainless steel surface
- **Shader**: The edge split modifier has been applied, which is evident in the crisp, defined edges between surface facets, creating clean geometric boundaries without smoothing

## Model Details
The revolver appears to be a magnum-style handgun with:
- **Barrel**: Long, cylindrical with subtle surface articulation
- **Cylinder**: Clearly visible with individual chamber details
- **Grip**: Textured handle with ergonomic contours
- **Trigger Assembly**: Detailed mechanical components visible
- **Sights**: Defined front and rear sight elements

## Camera Perspective
The model is positioned in a three-quarter view, rotated to display both the profile and front aspect of the firearm, optimizing visual clarity of the mechanical components.

## Title Bar
The yellow text "three.js - Edge Split Modifier" confirms this is a demonstration of Three.js's edge split functionality, showcasing how it preserves sharp boundaries in low-poly geometry.
