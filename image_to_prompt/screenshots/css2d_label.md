# Three.js Scene Description

## Overview
This is a minimalist orrery visualization depicting the Earth-Moon system rendered in Three.js against a pure black background.

## Scene Elements

### Celestial Bodies
1. **Earth** (right side)
   - Positioned at approximately the center-right of the viewport
   - Labeled with text "Earth"
   - Mass annotation: 5.972×10²⁴ kg
   - Rendered as a small spherical object with subtle shading

2. **Moon** (left side)
   - Positioned to the left of Earth
   - Labeled with text "Moon"
   - Mass annotation: 7.342×10²² kg
   - Noticeably smaller in scale compared to Earth, reflecting actual mass ratios
   - Rendered as a smaller sphere

### Visual Structure
- **Orbital Line**: A thin vertical white line connects the two bodies, representing either the orbital plane or relative positioning
- **Scale Reference**: The vastly different sizes of the celestial bodies demonstrate relative scale (though not to true astronomical proportions for visibility)

### Information Display
- Clean, white typography labels each body
- Scientific notation displays precise mass values for each celestial object
- Labels positioned directly above their corresponding objects

## Technical Presentation
- Minimal, dark theme optimized for clarity
- Geometric precision in object positioning
- Professional, educational aesthetic suitable for astronomy or physics applications
