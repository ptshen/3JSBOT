# 3D Scene Description

This three.js scene displays a comparison between two distinct 3D representations of a rectangular box or cube structure, positioned against a black background.

## Left Side - Wireframe Model
- **Geometry**: A wireframe rendering of a rectangular prism/cuboid
- **Style**: Clean white lines on transparent background
- **Construction**: Shows all edges and internal diagonals of the box
- **Perspective**: Isometric or similar 3D projection that clearly reveals the three-dimensional form
- **Details**: The wireframe includes both outer edges and internal structural lines, creating a complex geometric pattern that emphasizes the box's internal volume and spatial relationships

## Right Side - Textured/Solid Model
- **Geometry**: The same rectangular prism form
- **Material**: Realistic brick or terracotta-colored texture
- **Surface**: Appears to be a solid render with a uniform brick pattern across the visible faces
- **Lighting**: Subtle lighting creates minimal shadow definition
- **Appearance**: More photorealistic compared to the wireframe counterpart

## Overall Composition
The side-by-side layout effectively demonstrates the contrast between:
- **Structural visualization** (left) - emphasizing geometry and topology
- **Material representation** (right) - emphasizing surface appearance and texture

This is a typical educational or comparative visualization commonly used in 3D graphics to show how the same geometric model can be rendered in different ways.
