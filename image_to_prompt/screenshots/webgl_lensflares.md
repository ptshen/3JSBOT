# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a dynamic, particle-based scene rendered in Three.js featuring a central luminous focal point surrounded by floating geometric elements against a dark background. The composition uses dramatic lighting and depth to create visual interest and movement.

## Key Elements

### Central Light Source
- A bright, golden-yellow glowing cube positioned at the center of the scene
- Emits an intense radiant glow with a warm, amber hue
- Serves as the primary light source illuminating the surrounding environment
- Creates lens flare and bloom effects typical of high-intensity lighting

### Floating Cubes/Particles
- Multiple cube-shaped objects of varying sizes distributed throughout the 3D space
- Positioned both near and far from the camera, creating depth
- Some cubes are illuminated and appear cream or pale yellow, reflecting light from the central source
- Others fade into darkness at the periphery, creating atmospheric perspective
- Appears to follow a dispersal pattern, suggesting dynamic motion or explosion-like behavior

### Lighting & Atmosphere
- Warm color temperature dominated by golden and amber tones
- Strong contrast between the illuminated central area and the dark surroundings
- Realistic light falloff and shadow rendering
- The dark background emphasizes the brightness of the central light source

### Overall Mood
The scene conveys energy, transformation, or a moment of impact—reminiscent of an explosion, energy burst, or particle system demonstration showcasing advanced lighting and material rendering capabilities in Three.js.
