# Three.js Scene Description

## Lighting and Composition
This is a carefully composed visualization showing the **progression of lunar phases** rendered in three.js with sophisticated lighting techniques. The scene employs a dark, space-like background (black) to emphasize the celestial subject matter.

## Objects and Layout
- **Top Row**: Approximately 10-11 spheres representing the moon at different phases, arranged horizontally from left to right
- **Bottom Row**: A mirrored or complementary set of spheres, also arranged linearly
- **Small Dots**: Faint, smaller points below each row, likely representing stars or depth cues in the scene

## Lighting and Shading
- **Key Light**: Strong directional lighting creates dramatic shadow gradients across each sphere
- **Phase Progression**: The lighting direction shifts subtly across the sequence, creating the illusion of the moon's phases as it orbits Earth
- **Material Properties**: The spheres appear to use a realistic matte material with:
  - High-quality specular highlights on the illuminated portions
  - Deep shadows on the unlit side
  - Soft penumbra transitions between light and dark
- **Reflections**: Subtle reflections visible on the sphere surfaces, suggesting a semi-matte material

## Overall Aesthetic
This appears to be an **educational or astronomical visualization**, demonstrating lunar phases through 3D rendering. The clean composition and professional lighting suggest it's meant for educational content, planetarium software, or scientific visualization purposes.
