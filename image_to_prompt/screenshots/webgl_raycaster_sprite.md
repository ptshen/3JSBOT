# Three.js Scene Description

This is a minimalist 3D scene featuring three blue rectangular boxes (cuboids) arranged in a dynamic composition against a light gray background.

## Scene Elements:

**Box 1 (Upper Left):**
- A tall, narrow rectangle rotated approximately 30-40 degrees clockwise
- Positioned in the upper left quadrant
- Maintains a vibrant medium blue color

**Box 2 (Center):**
- A vertical rectangle standing upright with minimal rotation
- Positioned in the center-right area
- Similar blue coloring to Box 1
- Taller and more traditionally oriented compared to its neighbors

**Box 3 (Lower Right):**
- A long, flat rectangle rotated at an aggressive angle (roughly 45-50 degrees)
- Positioned in the lower right portion of the viewport
- Creates a diagonal compositional line across the scene

## Lighting & Materials:
- Clean, uniform lighting that creates subtle shading on the blue surfaces
- Appears to use basic Phong or Lambert materials with minimal specularity
- No visible shadows or complex material properties
- Simple background providing high contrast

## Overall Composition:
The three boxes create a balanced, abstract arrangement with varied rotations and scales, suggesting a study in geometric relationships and 3D space. The scene is clean, modern, and suitable for UI/UX demonstrations or minimalist 3D visualizations.
