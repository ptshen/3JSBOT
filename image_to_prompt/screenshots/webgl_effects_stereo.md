# 3D Scene Description: Winter Courtyard with Floating Spheres

## Overall Composition
This is a stereoscopic 3D render (displayed as a side-by-side comparison for VR/3D viewing) depicting a serene winter courtyard scene at dusk or early evening.

## Environment & Setting
- **Time of Day**: Twilight/early evening with a cool, neutral gray-blue sky
- **Season**: Winter, with snow covering the ground creating a uniform white surface
- **Atmosphere**: Quiet, contemplative mood with soft, ambient lighting

## Architectural Elements
- **Building**: A classical, multi-story residential or institutional structure with warm golden-yellow facade lighting
- **Windows**: Multiple illuminated windows creating a rhythmic pattern across the building's facade, suggesting interior warmth contrasting with the cold exterior
- **Design Style**: Traditional/classical architecture with symmetrical proportions
- **Position**: Centered in the composition, anchoring the scene

## Natural Elements
- **Trees**: Bare, skeletal deciduous trees flanking both sides of the courtyard, their branches creating intricate silhouettes against the twilight sky
- **Ground**: Pristine snow covering the courtyard floor

## Artistic/Fantastical Elements
- **Floating Spheres**: Large translucent or reflective spheres suspended at various heights throughout the scene, creating surreal, dreamlike qualities
- **Sphere Count**: Approximately 4-5 visible spheres of varying sizes
- **Effect**: These spheres appear to be catching and reflecting ambient light, adding a magical, otherworldly dimension to an otherwise realistic scene

## Lighting
- **Quality**: Soft, diffuse ambient lighting typical of evening
- **Color Temperature**: Warm interior lighting contrasting with cool exterior tones
- **Shadows**: Subtle, creating depth without harsh contrast

## Technical Execution (Three.js)
- **Rendering**: Clean, well-optimized polygon geometry
- **Material Properties**: Realistic specular surfaces on spheres, diffuse materials for architecture and natural elements
- **Depth of Field**: Clear focus throughout, maintaining scene legibility
- **Performance**: Well-balanced complexity for real-time rendering

This scene masterfully blends realism with surrealism, creating a contemplative winter landscape enhanced by fantastical floating elements.
