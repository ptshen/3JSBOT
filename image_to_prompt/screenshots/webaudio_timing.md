# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a three.js rendered scene depicting a **gravity well or spacetime curvature visualization**. The scene uses a minimalist dark background (black) with strategic lighting to create depth and focus.

## Key Elements

### Curved Blue Plane
- The dominant feature is a large **blue surface** that curves downward in the center
- This represents a warped or curved space (reminiscent of Einstein's spacetime curvature)
- The surface has a subtle gradient and realistic material with slight specularity
- The edges fade into perspective, suggesting the plane extends beyond the visible area

### Spheres
There are multiple **gray/silver spheres** of varying sizes distributed throughout the scene:

- **Three spheres above the plane** - positioned in the dark upper space, appearing to float above the curved surface
- **Two spheres resting on/within the curved plane** - showing how objects interact with the warped space
- The spheres have realistic materials with highlights, suggesting area or directional lighting

### Lighting
- **Soft, diffuse lighting** creates subtle shadows and highlights on the spheres
- **Key light** positioned to create dimension without harsh shadows
- The lighting emphasizes the 3D topology of the curved plane

## Artistic Intent
This visualization effectively demonstrates gravitational effects or spacetime curvature, commonly used to illustrate physics concepts, demonstrate WebGL capabilities, or create abstract scientific visualizations.
