# 3D MRI Brain Scan Visualization

## Scene Description

This is a sophisticated three.js medical visualization depicting a **sagittal (side-view) cross-section of the human brain and skull**. The rendering demonstrates professional medical imaging quality.

### Key Visual Elements:

**Anatomical Structure:**
- Complete lateral profile of the human head, including the skull, brain tissue, and internal structures
- Clearly visible brain hemispheres with detailed surface convolutions (gyri and sulci)
- Brainstem and cerebellum rendered in the posterior region
- Facial skeleton profile on the anterior side

**Rendering Characteristics:**
- **Grayscale color palette** typical of MRI output, with varying gray tones representing different tissue densities
- **High-contrast lighting** that emphasizes depth and anatomical detail
- **Smooth material properties** suggesting realistic tissue representation
- **White outline/edge highlighting** around the silhouette for enhanced definition

**Technical Execution:**
- Professional medical imaging aesthetic
- Proper perspective projection from a lateral viewpoint
- Sophisticated geometry modeling to capture intricate brain anatomy
- Appropriate use of lighting to create dimension without distraction

### Context:
This appears to be a medical education or diagnostic visualization tool, commonly used in neurology, radiology, or medical training applications. The quality suggests implementation of advanced three.js features including custom shaders, proper lighting models, and high-resolution geometry assets.
