# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a professionally rendered 3D scene featuring a minimalist product display setup with a dark forest-green background and a reflective ground plane.

## Primary Elements

### Color Bars
Three vertical rectangular prisms are arranged side-by-side in the center:
- **Left bar**: Vibrant cobalt blue
- **Center bar**: Bright lime green
- **Right bar**: Coral/salmon pink

Each bar has clean, sharp edges and appears to be roughly equal in height and width, creating a balanced composition.

### Central Logo
Superimposed on the green center bar is a stylized black infinity symbol or curved ribbon design with accent colors (cyan and yellow/gold highlights), suggesting this is a branding or logo showcase.

## Lighting & Reflections

### Ground Plane
The reflective surface below the bars creates:
- Clear mirror reflections of all three colored bars
- Chromatic aberration or color separation effects extending outward
- Blue glow on the left side
- Green luminescence in the center
- Orange/warm glow on the right side

This creates a beautiful color bloom effect typical of high-quality three.js rendering with post-processing.

### Ambient Lighting
Soft, even illumination with subtle shadows suggests:
- Key light positioned above
- Fill light maintaining shadow detail
- Environment lighting contributing to the polished appearance

## Technical Qualities
- Clean geometry with no visible artifacts
- Professional color grading
- Sophisticated material properties (matte bars with reflective ground)
- Post-processing effects (bloom, possibly HDR tone mapping)
