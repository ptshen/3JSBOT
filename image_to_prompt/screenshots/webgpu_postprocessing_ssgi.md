# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist three.js rendered interior space featuring a clean, geometric aesthetic with strong color blocking and controlled lighting.

## Environment
- **Room**: A cubic or rectangular enclosed space with neutral beige/grey flooring
- **Walls**: Two dominant colored walls create a stark contrast—a deep red wall on the left side and a vibrant lime green wall on the right side
- **Ceiling**: A light neutral tone (beige/white) with an embedded circular ceiling light that emits soft, diffuse illumination
- **Lighting**: The overhead fixture provides the primary light source, creating subtle shadows and graduated lighting across the surfaces

## Geometric Objects
The scene contains several minimalist rectangular forms arranged throughout the space:
- **Left side**: A tall red/muted pink vertical rectangular prism
- **Center**: A gradient-shaded rectangular box (transitions between colors, possibly reflecting the nearby walls)
- **Right-front**: A dark grey or charcoal cubic/rectangular form positioned lower in the composition
- **Background**: Additional geometric shapes suggesting depth and spatial layering

## Aesthetic & Technical Elements
- **Material Properties**: Surfaces appear to use matte materials with realistic shadow mapping and ambient occlusion
- **Color Palette**: Primary colors (red, green) with neutral greys and beiges creating visual tension
- **Perspective**: The viewpoint is positioned at eye-level within the space, creating an immersive architectural visualization
- **Rendering Quality**: Clean, professional rendering with proper shadow casting and surface reflections

This appears to be a study in color theory, spatial design, and lighting within a 3D graphics framework.
