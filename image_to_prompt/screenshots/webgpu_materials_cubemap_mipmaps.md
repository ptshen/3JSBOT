# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist dark-themed 3D visualization featuring two reflective spheres positioned against a pure black background. The scene demonstrates sophisticated material rendering and environmental mapping techniques.

## Spheres and Materials

### Left Sphere
- **Material**: Highly reflective mirror-like surface with metallic properties
- **Content**: Displays a clear, undistorted reflection of an architectural scene showing a white building with a distinctive dome or rotunda structure, surrounded by geometric paving or courtyard flooring
- **Reflectivity**: Nearly perfect specular reflection, acting as a polished chrome or silver surface

### Right Sphere
- **Material**: Frosted or matte reflective surface with significant specular highlights
- **Appearance**: Shows the same architectural scene but heavily obscured, diffused, and brightened
- **Effect**: Appears to be the same environment mapped with high roughness or bloom/glow effects, creating an ethereal, cloud-like appearance

## Lighting
- **Key Light**: Positioned to create strong specular highlights on both spheres, particularly visible on the right sphere's upper surface
- **Environment**: Likely using an HDRI (High Dynamic Range Image) or environment map for realistic reflections
- **Contrast**: Strong interplay between bright reflections and the dark background creates dramatic visual impact

## Technical Elements
- **Rendering**: Clean anti-aliasing and smooth surface geometry
- **Shadow/AO**: Subtle ambient occlusion at the sphere bases
- **Camera Setup**: Orthographic or wide-angle perspective with clear separation between objects

This scene effectively demonstrates material differentiation and environmental mapping capabilities in three.js.
