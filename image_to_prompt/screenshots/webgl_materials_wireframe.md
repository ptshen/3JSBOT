# 3D Scene Description: Wireframe Head Models

## Overall Composition
The scene presents two identical, stylized human head models rendered in wireframe against a pure black background, positioned side by side in a symmetrical arrangement. The heads face forward in a neutral, frontal view.

## Technical Details

**Rendering Style:**
- Pure wireframe visualization with white/light gray edges
- No surface fills or materials—only mesh topology visible
- Minimalist aesthetic typical of three.js demonstrations

**Geometry & Structure:**
- Each head is constructed from a dense triangular mesh
- The mesh density varies across facial features:
  - **Denser concentration** around facial features (eyes, nose, mouth area)
  - **Sparser geometry** on larger planar surfaces (cheeks, forehead, chin)
- Approximately 3,000-5,000 polygons per head (estimated)

**Facial Features:**
- Eye sockets are clearly defined with concentrated vertex topology
- Nasal structure is geometrically represented but simplified
- Mouth area shows distinct mesh articulation
- Cheekbones and facial contours are implied through mesh density variation

## Lighting & Atmosphere
- **Lighting:** Single dominant light source, likely from a frontal camera-relative position
- **Background:** Solid black void, emphasizing the geometric forms
- **Contrast:** High contrast between white wireframe and dark background

## Spatial Layout
- Heads are vertically centered
- Approximately 30-40% horizontal spacing between them
- Equal scale and identical orientation suggest a comparative or mirrored demonstration

This type of visualization is commonly used for demonstrating 3D modeling techniques, character development, or geometric mesh optimization.
