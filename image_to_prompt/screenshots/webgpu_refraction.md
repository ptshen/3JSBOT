# Three.js 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a stylized 3D corridor or tunnel scene rendered in Three.js, featuring a symmetrical perspective view looking down a central passage toward a distant vanishing point.

## Structural Elements

**Walls:**
- **Left Wall**: Bright red surface occupying the left third of the viewport
- **Right Wall**: Vibrant lime green surface mirroring the left wall's position
- **Back Wall**: Periwinkle/cornflower blue, receding into depth and creating the sense of a distant end point
- **Top Surface**: Neutral gray, forming the ceiling or upper plane

## Lighting & Atmosphere
- **Soft, diffuse lighting** illuminates the scene evenly, with subtle shadows defining the geometric planes
- The blue back wall receives slightly stronger illumination, creating visual depth
- **Ambient light dominates**, giving the scene a clean, clinical appearance with minimal harsh shadows

## Details
- **Spherical object**: A small white/silver sphere visible in the middle distance on the blue back wall, likely a light source or focal point object
- **Anti-aliased edges**: Slight pixelation visible on the geometric boundaries, characteristic of real-time 3D rendering

## Aesthetic
The scene demonstrates clean geometric rendering with complementary color theory (red-green opposition), suggesting this may be a technical demo, testing environment, or abstract visualization rather than a realistic scene.
