# 3D Scene Description

## Composition
This is a minimalist three.js scene featuring a single geometric object against a pure black background, creating a stark, high-contrast composition.

## Main Object
**Red Cube**: A bright, vivid red cube positioned in the center-left portion of the frame. The cube demonstrates proper three-dimensional rendering with visible faces showing depth and perspective.

## Lighting and Shading
- **Key Light Source**: A directional or positional light positioned above and to the right of the cube, creating clear shadow and highlight differentiation
- **Face Visibility**: The cube displays multiple visible faces:
  - The front-facing surface appears as a solid bright red
  - The left side face is rendered in a darker red tone, indicating shadow
  - The top surface is slightly highlighted, showing the light direction
- **No Ambient Occlusion**: The cube sits cleanly against the black background with no ground plane or shadows visible

## Camera and Perspective
- **Isometric-style view**: The cube is presented in a three-quarter perspective
- **Centered Composition**: Positioned slightly left and center in the frame
- **Clean Framing**: Substantial negative space around the object

## Technical Aspects
- **Rendering Quality**: Smooth edge rendering typical of three.js WebGL output
- **Material**: The red appears to use a standard Phong or Lambert material with basic lighting calculations
- **Background**: Pure black (likely RGB 0,0,0) providing maximum contrast

This is a classic example of basic three.js rendering, often used as a starter scene or demonstration of 3D object rendering fundamentals.
