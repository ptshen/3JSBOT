# 3D Scene Description: Material Spheres Showcase

## Overall Composition
This is a carefully curated three.js demonstration displaying six spheres arranged in a linear progression, positioned in the foreground against a realistic, photorealistic interior environment backdrop.

## The Spheres (Left to Right)
1. **Clear Glass/Crystal** - Transparent sphere with high refraction, showing mirrored reflections of the environment
2. **Polished Chrome/Mirror** - Highly reflective metallic sphere with mirror-like surface properties
3. **Matte White** - Diffuse white sphere with minimal specularity, demonstrating basic lambertian materials
4. **Rose Gold/Copper** - Reflective metallic sphere with warm, golden-bronze tones
5. **Matte Black** - Non-reflective dark sphere with maximum light absorption
6. **Neon Lime Green** - Bright, vibrant glossy sphere with saturated color and moderate specularity

## Environment
- **Setting**: Elegant gallery or museum interior with classical architecture
- **Walls**: Soft yellow/cream colored surfaces
- **Flooring**: Warm wooden parquet
- **Lighting**: Overhead chandelier providing ambient illumination
- **Artwork**: Framed paintings visible on walls in the background
- **Architecture**: Doorways and white trim visible, suggesting a multi-room gallery space

## Lighting & Rendering
The scene demonstrates advanced material properties through:
- Environment mapping reflecting the gallery space
- Specular highlights and Fresnel effects on metallic and glossy surfaces
- Realistic shadow casting
- High dynamic range rendering capturing both bright reflections and ambient occlusion

This is a classic **material showcase** scene commonly used to demonstrate physically-based rendering (PBR) capabilities in three.js.
