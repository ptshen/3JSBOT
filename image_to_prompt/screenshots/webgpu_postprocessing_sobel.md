# 3D Scene Description: Chinese Dragon Wireframe

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist wireframe rendering of a traditional Chinese dragon, displayed against a pure black background. The scene exemplifies clean, line-based 3D visualization typical of three.js educational or artistic projects.

## Visual Characteristics

**Rendering Style:**
- Pure white/cream colored wireframe lines on black background
- No fill geometry—only edge detection or wireframe material applied
- High contrast, creating a striking silhouette effect

**Dragon Anatomy (Left to Right):**
1. **Head**: Angular, pointed snout with pronounced features
2. **Horns/Antlers**: Upward-sweeping protrusions suggesting traditional Chinese dragon characteristics
3. **Body**: Undulating, serpentine form with clear segmentation
4. **Limbs**: Visible appendages suggesting the classic dragon posture
5. **Tail**: Flowing rear section with organic, curved geometry

## Technical Elements
- **Lighting**: Ambient or edge-based visualization
- **Camera Angle**: Three-quarter view perspective
- **Polygon Density**: Moderate complexity—enough detail to recognize the subject while maintaining clarity
- **Material**: Wireframe shader, revealing the underlying mesh topology

## Artistic Impact
The monochromatic wireframe approach creates an elegant, technical aesthetic—simultaneously scientific and artistic, evoking both computational geometry and traditional Chinese cultural symbolism.
