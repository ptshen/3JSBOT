# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist three.js scene featuring a single wooden crate or box rendered against a pure black background, creating strong visual contrast and emphasis on the object.

## The Crate
**Structure:**
- A cubic wooden box with a realistic wood texture
- Vertical wooden planks forming the face of the crate, rendered with visible grain and weathering
- Natural brown and tan wood coloration with subtle color variation across the surface

**Details:**
- A dark diagonal brace or support beam runs from the upper-left to lower-right across the front face
- The brace appears to be a structural reinforcement, typical of shipping crates or storage boxes
- The wood shows realistic wear, with slight discoloration and natural texture variation

## Lighting & Rendering
- **Lighting:** Appears to use a single or primary light source creating subtle shadows and depth on the wooden planks
- **Shading:** Realistic diffuse shading on the wooden surface with normal mapping to enhance the texture detail
- **Perspective:** Isometric or slightly angled view showing the front face of the crate
- **Shadows:** Subtle shadows cast by the diagonal brace create dimension

## Atmosphere
- Black background provides maximum contrast and focus
- Isolated, clean presentation typical of product visualization or game asset showcase
- Professional, clean rendering with no UI elements
