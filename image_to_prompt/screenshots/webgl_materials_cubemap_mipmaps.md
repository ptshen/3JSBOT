# Three.js Scene Description

This scene depicts **two reflective spheres** positioned against a black background, demonstrating advanced material and lighting techniques in three.js.

## Left Sphere - High Detail Reflective Sphere
- **Material**: Highly reflective metallic or polished surface with excellent specular highlights
- **Reflection**: Clear, sharp reflections of the surrounding environment
- **Content**: Reflects a detailed architectural scene featuring:
  - A white stone or concrete building with classical architecture
  - A domed or curved roof structure
  - Grid-like floor pattern or courtyard paving
  - Natural outdoor lighting creating distinct shadows
- **Finish**: Mirror-like quality with minimal diffusion

## Right Sphere - Diffuse/Matte Sphere
- **Material**: Matte or frosted surface with high roughness
- **Reflection**: Heavily diffused, soft reflections of the same scene
- **Appearance**: The architectural content is visible but heavily obscured by:
  - Surface roughness causing light scattering
  - Significant blur and diffusion of reflected details
  - Subtle, cloudy appearance
- **Finish**: Translucent or frosted glass-like quality

## Lighting & Composition
- **Illumination**: Appears to be image-based lighting (IBL) or environment mapping
- **Contrast**: The juxtaposition effectively demonstrates the difference between **specular (smooth) and diffuse (rough) surface properties**
- **Purpose**: Classic material comparison showcase commonly used to demonstrate physically-based rendering (PBR) principles

This is an excellent example of material demonstration in three.js, commonly used for educational purposes or portfolio work.
