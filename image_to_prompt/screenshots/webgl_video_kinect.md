# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a 3D wireframe or point-cloud visualization of a human figure rendered against a dark background, utilizing three.js's sophisticated rendering capabilities.

## Visual Characteristics

**Geometry & Structure:**
- The figure is constructed from a dense mesh of small cubic or cubic particles arranged in a grid pattern
- Displays a full-body human silhouette in a relaxed, standing pose with arms at sides
- The point-cloud density creates a solid form while maintaining a crystalline, digital aesthetic

**Color Scheme:**
- **Primary:** Electric blue dominates the upper torso, head, and shoulders
- **Secondary:** Cyan/turquoise gradient visible on the right arm and lower portions
- **Accent:** Teal to green color transition particularly visible on the extended right forearm/hand area
- The color gradation suggests either a **height-based or position-based color mapping** or **lighting simulation**

**Lighting & Atmosphere:**
- Stark black background creates high contrast
- Minimal ambient lighting, allowing individual voxel/particle definition to remain visible
- The blue-to-cyan-to-teal gradient implies either directional lighting or custom shader coloring based on spatial coordinates

## Technical Aspects
- Likely uses **BufferGeometry** with **Points** material or custom **ShaderMaterial**
- The voxelated aesthetic suggests particle-based or cubic mesh construction
- Demonstrates advanced three.js capabilities for real-time 3D visualization

This style is commonly used in medical visualization, digital art, or interactive human figure demonstrations.
