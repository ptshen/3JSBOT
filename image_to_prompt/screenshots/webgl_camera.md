# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a split-screen visualization featuring two distinct 3D scenes rendered in Three.js against dark backgrounds.

## Left Scene: Geometric Sphere
- **Primary Object**: A wireframe sphere constructed from interconnected triangular facets
- **Wireframe Style**: White/light gray lines forming a geodesic dome structure
- **Internal Element**: A blue vector or line segment positioned within the sphere's center, suggesting directional data or a force vector
- **Lighting**: Minimal ambient lighting with emphasis on the wireframe geometry
- **Background**: Pure black, creating high contrast with the white geometry

## Right Scene: Light Source and Cone
- **Primary Light**: A glowing white spherical object (likely representing a point light or camera position) positioned on the right side
- **Geometric Indicator**: A cone or pyramid shape with orange/amber-colored edges emanating from the sphere
- **Visual Purpose**: The cone appears to represent either:
  - A camera frustum (field of view)
  - A light source's illumination cone
  - A detection or sensor range
- **Spatial Representation**: The cone extends leftward toward the center of the scene, suggesting directional focus or emission
- **Texture**: Grainy, noisy background giving a technical or scientific visualization feel
- **Color Scheme**: Green accents on the sphere, amber/orange edges on the cone

## Overall Purpose
This appears to be a technical demonstration of 3D visualization concepts—possibly showing scene graph relationships, camera frustums, or spatial analysis tools in Three.js.
