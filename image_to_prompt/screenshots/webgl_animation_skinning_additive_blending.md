# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist 3D rendering featuring a stylized human figure model rendered in a soft, peachy-pink tone against a clean, neutral environment.

## Figure Details
- **Model Type**: A simplified, geometric anatomical figure with rounded, smooth proportions
- **Pose**: Standing in a relaxed contrapposto stance with legs slightly apart and arms at the sides
- **Color**: Uniform warm salmon/peachy-pink material with subtle shading that provides dimension
- **Construction**: The figure appears to be composed of basic geometric forms - spheres for joints and simplified cylinders for limbs, creating a stylized, non-realistic aesthetic
- **Detail Level**: Very low poly count with minimal anatomical detail, emphasizing form over realism

## Lighting & Shadows
- **Lighting**: Soft, diffuse three-point or ambient lighting that eliminates harsh shadows while maintaining form visibility
- **Shadow**: A subtle gray shadow cast on the ground plane beneath the figure, indicating directional light from above-left
- **Ambient Occlusion**: Subtle shadowing in joint areas enhances depth perception

## Environment
- **Background**: Pure white or light gray gradient ceiling
- **Ground Plane**: Clean white surface with slight gradient
- **Context**: Completely neutral, studio-like setting with no additional objects or scenery

## Technical Execution
- Clean, professionally rendered three.js output
- Demonstrates good lighting setup and material properties
- Suitable for educational, medical, or character animation reference purposes
