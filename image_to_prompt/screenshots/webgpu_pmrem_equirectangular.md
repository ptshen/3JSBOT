# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a meticulously arranged grid of 30 spheres (6 columns × 5 rows) displayed against a soft, gradient background transitioning from warm peachy-pink tones on the left to cool blue tones on the right.

## Lighting and Materials
The scene demonstrates sophisticated material progression:
- **Top-left spheres**: Highly reflective metallic gold/brass material with pronounced mirror-like reflections and environment mapping
- **Progressive transition**: Moving right and downward, the spheres gradually shift from reflective metallic finishes to matte, pearl-white surfaces
- **Bottom rows**: Pure matte white spheres with minimal specularity

## Rendering Characteristics
- **Anti-aliasing**: Smooth edges indicate quality rendering
- **Environment mapping**: Visible reflections of the background gradient and studio lighting in the metallic spheres
- **Soft shadows**: Subtle shadowing beneath spheres suggests global illumination or shadow mapping
- **Depth of field**: Slight potential depth variation across the grid creates visual hierarchy

## Visual Purpose
This appears to be a **material demonstration** or **shader showcase** — illustrating the progression from highly polished reflective surfaces to diffuse matte finishes, commonly used for:
- Portfolio demonstrations
- Material library previews
- Rendering engine capabilities showcase
- PBR (Physically Based Rendering) workflow examples

The gradient background provides excellent contrast while the grid arrangement emphasizes systematic material transitions.
