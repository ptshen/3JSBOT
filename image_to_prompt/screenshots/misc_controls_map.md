# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist, isometric-style cityscape rendered in Three.js, featuring an abstract urban landscape with a clean, modern aesthetic. The scene uses a subtle color palette and atmospheric perspective to create depth.

## Visual Elements

**Architecture:**
- Multiple rectangular buildings of varying heights arranged in a grid-like pattern
- Buildings rendered as simple geometric shapes (primarily boxes/cuboids)
- Heights create an irregular skyline, suggesting a dynamic urban environment
- Isometric projection gives the scene a distinctive, tilted perspective

**Lighting & Shading:**
- Soft, diffused lighting creates subtle shadows on building faces
- Two-tone shading visible on vertical surfaces, with darker sides facing away from the light source
- Gentle ambient lighting prevents harsh contrasts

**Color Palette:**
- Predominantly cool tones: grays, off-whites, and muted blues
- Buildings in the foreground appear darker (navy/slate blue)
- Progressive fade to lighter shades toward the background
- Neutral gray background blends seamlessly with distant structures

**Atmosphere:**
- Atmospheric perspective creates a hazy, foggy quality
- Distant buildings fade into the background, enhancing depth perception
- Creates a dreamy, ethereal mood rather than a photorealistic cityscape

## Artistic Style
This represents a popular low-poly, minimal design approach commonly used in modern web design, data visualization, and contemporary digital art.
