# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist three.js scene featuring a single geometric object rendered against a stark black background, creating high contrast and emphasizing the form through negative space.

## Primary Element
**White Square/Cube Face**
- A large, flat white rectangular plane or cube face dominates the center-left portion of the frame
- The geometry appears to be a perfect square or near-square proportion
- Sharp, clean edges with no visible distortion or perspective warping suggest the camera is positioned perpendicular or nearly perpendicular to the surface
- The bright white color (likely RGB: 255, 255, 255) contrasts sharply against the black environment

## Lighting
- **Key Light**: Appears to be positioned frontally or slightly offset, creating even illumination across the white surface with minimal shadows
- No visible ambient occlusion or complex shadow interplay on the white plane itself
- The absence of visible edges or depth suggests either orthographic camera projection or a perfectly head-on perspective view

## Background & Environment
- Solid black background (RGB: 0, 0, 0)
- No visible ground plane, sky, or environmental elements
- Appears to be an empty scene with default/black clear color

## Technical Notes
- Clean, clinical aesthetic typical of basic three.js demonstrations
- No visible textures, normal maps, or material complexity
- Likely uses basic MeshBasicMaterial or similar for the white geometry
