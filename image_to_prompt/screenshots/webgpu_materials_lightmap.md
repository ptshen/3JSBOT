# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist three.js rendered scene featuring two rectangular box geometries positioned on a flat sandy plane against a soft, overcast sky backdrop.

## Objects

### Ground Plane
- A large, textured sandy/beige surface serving as the foundation
- Subtle surface variations suggest a sandy terrain material with realistic shading
- Extends across the entire bottom of the viewport, creating horizon perspective

### Box Geometries
**Left Box (Red/Coral):**
- Smaller cube positioned in the foreground-left
- Warm reddish-coral coloration with matte surface finish
- Exhibits realistic shadow and depth perception against the ground plane

**Right Box (Brown/Tan):**
- Taller rectangular prism in the center-background
- Warm brown-tan coloration slightly darker than the ground
- Demonstrates proper perspective with visible depth relative to the smaller cube
- Shows realistic face shading with subtle lighting differentiation

## Lighting & Atmosphere
- Soft, diffused overhead lighting suggesting cloudy or overcast conditions
- Gentle shadows cast by both objects provide spatial grounding
- Warm color temperature overall, with muted, earthy tones
- Light gray/off-white sky with no distinct light source, creating even illumination

## Technical Rendering
- Clean, simple geometry showcasing basic 3D fundamentals
- Effective use of depth and perspective
- Professional material rendering with appropriate specularity and diffusion
