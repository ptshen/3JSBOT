# Three.js Scene Description

This is a minimalist 3D visualization displaying three distinct material samples arranged horizontally against a black background. Each cube or plane represents a different surface texture commonly used in 3D modeling and game development:

## Left Element - Wooden Planks
A square surface with a warm, golden-brown wood grain texture. Diagonal cross-beams create an X-pattern across the surface, suggesting a wooden crate or barn door construction. The texture has good surface definition with visible grain lines and natural wood coloration.

## Center Element - Foliage/Nature Texture
An organic, dappled texture featuring yellows, greens, and browns with an irregular, mottled pattern. This appears to represent leaves, moss, or dense vegetation—possibly a tileable nature texture used for terrain or foliage mapping in 3D environments.

## Right Element - Brick Wall
A photorealistic red brick texture showing individual brick units separated by mortar joints. The bricks display natural color variation with rust-red and darker tones, and the mortar lines create a regular grid pattern typical of masonry construction. This is a commonly used tileable texture in architectural visualization.

## Overall Presentation
The scene demonstrates texture mapping capabilities with three distinct material samples, likely used as a material library preview or asset showcase in a 3D graphics application. The black background provides contrast to highlight the textures, and consistent lighting ensures each material is clearly visible.
