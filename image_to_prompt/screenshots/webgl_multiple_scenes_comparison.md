# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist 3D visualization featuring a geometric sphere positioned centrally against a split-color background. The scene demonstrates sophisticated shading and lighting techniques typical of Three.js renderings.

## Central Object
**The Sphere:**
- **Left Hemisphere**: Rendered as a smooth, matte white surface with subtle gradient shading that creates dimensional depth
- **Right Hemisphere**: Displays a wireframe geometry with a light blue/cyan coloration, showing a detailed polygonal mesh structure with interconnected vertices and edges
- **Center Point**: A small magenta/hot pink sphere positioned at the geometric center, serving as a focal point and likely representing an axis point or origin marker
- The transition between the two hemispheres is clean and precise, creating a striking "half-solid, half-wireframe" effect

## Background
- **Left Side**: Soft lime green (#C8E6A0 approximately)
- **Right Side**: Muted slate blue (#6FA3D1 approximately)
- The background creates a complementary color split that emphasizes the sphere's dual nature

## Lighting & Atmosphere
- Soft, ambient lighting with no harsh shadows
- The white hemisphere exhibits subtle specular highlights
- The wireframe side maintains visibility through translucency
- Overall clean, modern aesthetic suggesting a tech or scientific visualization context

This appears to be a conceptual or educational visualization, possibly representing concepts like data visualization, geometric transformation, or the duality of solid vs. computational geometry.
