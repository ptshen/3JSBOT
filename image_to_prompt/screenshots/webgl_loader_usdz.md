# 3D Scene Description: Potato Chip Package

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist product visualization rendered in Three.js, featuring a single subject isolated against a neutral, gradient background that transitions from light gray to warm off-white tones.

## Main Object: Snack Package
The central element is a **crinkled potato chip/snack bag** rendered with impressive material authenticity:

### Physical Characteristics
- **Shape**: Partially inflated pillow-style packaging with organic, naturalistic wrinkles and creases
- **Dimensions**: Medium-sized consumer product (appears to be approximately 150-200mm in width)
- **Material**: Metallic film with holographic properties, showing realistic light reflectivity
- **Color Palette**: Dominated by vibrant reds, pinks, and warm tones with blue accents and metallic gold highlights

### Surface Detail
- Multiple deep folds and crumples across the front and sides, creating dynamic shadow play
- Realistic specular highlights reflecting the three.js lighting setup
- The package appears slightly torn or worn at the upper corners, adding authenticity
- Text/branding visible on the surface (appears to be Asian characters, likely Korean or Japanese)

## Lighting & Rendering
- **Key Light**: Positioned to the upper left, creating dimensional shadows in the package creases
- **Material Properties**: Convincing plastic film shaders with appropriate specularity and roughness
- **Shadows**: Soft, ambient occlusion-based shadowing enhancing the crumpled geometry
- **Anti-aliasing**: Smooth edges indicating quality render settings

## Technical Execution
The model demonstrates advanced Three.js capabilities including complex geometry deformation, physically-based materials, and professional product visualization techniques.
