# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a stylized still-life arrangement rendered in three.js, featuring a carefully composed group of geometric and organic objects against a minimalist background with dramatic lighting.

## Background
- **Upper section**: A neutral gray gradient that transitions smoothly, suggesting soft ambient lighting
- **Lower section**: Pure black, creating strong contrast and visual separation
- **Lighting**: Appears to be lit from the upper left, creating soft shadows beneath the objects

## Objects

### 1. **Rabbit/Bunny Sculpture (Center-Left)**
- A white or light gray ceramic-style figurine
- Realistic anatomical proportions with detailed surface texture
- Sits in a relaxed, recumbent pose
- Demonstrates high-quality 3D modeling with subtle surface details and shading

### 2. **Green Cube (Left)**
- A bright, saturated lime/emerald green color
- Sharp, geometric form with clean edges
- Positioned to the left side of the composition
- Matte material finish

### 3. **Cyan/Turquoise Sphere (Front-Center)**
- A perfectly round orb with a glossy, reflective surface
- Bright cyan/aqua coloration
- Positioned lowest in the composition, partially occluded by the rabbit
- Demonstrates specular highlights suggesting glass or polished material

## Technical Qualities
- **Rendering**: Clean, high-quality three.js output
- **Materials**: Mix of matte and glossy surfaces
- **Lighting**: Sophisticated shadow casting and ambient occlusion
- **Composition**: Balanced asymmetrical arrangement with good visual hierarchy
