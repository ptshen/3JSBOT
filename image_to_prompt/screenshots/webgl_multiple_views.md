# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a multi-panel 3D visualization showcasing various spherical objects rendered with different visual styles and lighting conditions across four distinct quadrants with different background colors.

## Left Panel (Purple Background)
Three large geodesic spheres displaying a **low-poly icosphere geometry** with prominent triangular facets:
- **Left sphere**: Rainbow gradient transitioning from green on the left through yellow, orange, to red on the right
- **Center sphere**: Warm gradient from orange to red tones
- **Right sphere**: Deep burgundy to dark red coloring
- All three feature **Phong or standard material** with visible face divisions and subtle shading that emphasizes the geometric structure
- Positioned in a horizontal arrangement with slight overlapping

## Upper Right Panel (Teal Background)
Three small, **highly reflective metallic spheres** with:
- Polished chrome or mirror-like surface properties
- Yellow/gold and red coloration with strong specular highlights
- Demonstrate advanced **reflection and environment mapping**
- Positioned in a loose triangular arrangement
- Much smaller scale compared to the left panel

## Lower Right Panel (Dusty Rose/Mauve Background)
Three medium-sized **matte spheres** with:
- Deep red/crimson coloring
- Black and dark gradient tones on the rightmost sphere
- Diffuse, non-reflective material properties
- Arranged horizontally in a row

## Lighting & Technical Aspects
- **Multiple light sources** creating dimensional shading
- **Distinct material demonstrations**: reflective, diffuse, and gradient-based
- Professional color grading and geometric precision typical of Three.js WebGL rendering
