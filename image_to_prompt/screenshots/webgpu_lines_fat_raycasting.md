# Three.js Scene Description

## Overview
This is a vibrant, minimalist 3D visualization featuring a striking geometric composition against a pure black background, creating high contrast and visual impact.

## Scene Structure

### Upper Section
- **Red Dashed Ring**: A horizontal torus rendered with a dashed line pattern in bright red, positioned at the top of the composition
- **Purple/Magenta Transitional Ring**: Located directly below the red ring, this dashed torus transitions the color palette downward
- **Blue Dashed Ring**: Continues the vertical stack, rendered in a vivid blue with the same dashed line style
- **Cyan Connector**: A thin cyan/turquoise line or small element serves as a visual bridge between the upper rings and lower section

### Lower Section
- **Green Dashed Ring**: A horizontal dashed torus in bright green, positioned above the central pyramid form
- **Yellow Dashed Pyramid/Cone**: A three-dimensional pyramidal shape with dashed line rendering in bright yellow, serving as the focal point of the lower composition
- **Orange Base Ring**: A dashed torus in orange at the base, anchoring the entire structure

## Visual Characteristics
- **Line Style**: All geometric elements use dashed/segmented lines rather than solid fills
- **Color Palette**: A full RGB spectrum progression (red → magenta → blue → cyan → green → yellow → orange)
- **Rendering**: Clean, mathematical 3D geometry with no textures or lighting effects beyond basic material rendering
- **Symmetry**: Radially symmetric design with vertical axis alignment
- **Atmosphere**: Modern, technical aesthetic suggesting data visualization or abstract geometric art
