# 3D Scene Description

## Overview
This is a minimalist three.js visualization featuring a **bar chart or column graph** rendered in 3D space against a neutral gray background.

## Key Elements

### Geometry
- **Multiple rectangular prisms (bars)** arranged in a ascending/progressive formation
- Approximately 10-12 vertical columns of varying heights
- Each bar appears to increase slightly in height from left to right, suggesting an upward trend or growth pattern

### Materials & Lighting
- **Color scheme**: Deep red/maroon to bright crimson gradient
- The bars progress from darker red tones on the left to brighter, more saturated red on the right
- **Lighting**: Appears to use simple directional or ambient lighting, creating subtle shadows and depth perception on the bar surfaces
- The left-facing surfaces of the bars are slightly darker, suggesting a light source from the upper right

### Camera & Perspective
- **Isometric or 3/4 perspective view**, tilted at an angle
- Positioned to show both the height and depth of the bars effectively
- The viewpoint allows clear visualization of the chart's progression

### Background
- Solid, neutral **medium gray color**
- Provides clean contrast to the red bars without distraction

## Overall Impression
A clean, professional data visualization that emphasizes an upward trend or positive growth metric through a simple yet effective 3D bar chart design.
