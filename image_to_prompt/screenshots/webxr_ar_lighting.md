# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
A minimalist arrangement of nine spheres organized in a 3x3 grid against a pure black background. The spheres are positioned in three rows of three, creating a balanced, symmetrical composition that suggests mathematical precision.

## Sphere Characteristics

**Material & Texture:**
- The spheres feature a **realistic translucent/frosted material**, resembling polished quartz, moonstone, or opal
- They display subtle **iridescent properties** with soft color gradations across their surfaces
- The material has a **semi-transparent quality** with internal light scattering

**Lighting & Shading:**
- Each sphere demonstrates **advanced physically-based rendering (PBR)**
- Soft **specular highlights** indicate controlled directional lighting, likely a key light positioned upper-left
- **Subsurface scattering** effects create a warm, luminous glow within the spheres
- Subtle **shadowing** on the lower portions grounds the objects in 3D space

**Color Palette:**
- **Cool, pearlescent whites and silvers** dominate
- **Warm peachy-beige tones** visible in some spheres, particularly top-left
- Gentle **blue and lavender undertones** enhance the moonstone aesthetic

## Scene Setup
- **Three.js rendering** with high-quality sphere geometry (adequate polygon count for smooth appearance)
- **No visible geometry or floor plane** — pure focus on the spheres
- **Minimalist lighting setup** creating a gallery-like, professional presentation
- Black backdrop emphasizes the luminous quality of the materials

This composition evokes a meditative, almost mystical quality suitable for a product showcase, art installation, or scientific visualization.
