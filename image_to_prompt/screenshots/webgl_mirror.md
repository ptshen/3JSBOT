# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a three.js rendered 3D scene depicting an interior corner space with a modernist, geometric aesthetic. The scene uses a carefully controlled color palette and lighting setup to create visual interest and depth.

## Environment & Architecture
- **Walls**: Three prominent colored planes form the corner space:
  - **Left wall**: Vibrant red
  - **Back wall**: Rich blue/purple
  - **Right wall**: Bright lime green
- **Floor**: White/light gray geometric surface with circular apertures
- **Ceiling**: Neutral white/gray plane at the top
- **Overall structure**: Creates a clean, rectilinear corner room environment

## Objects & Geometry
- **Central Element**: A white geometric shape (appears to be a multi-sphere or bubble-like form) positioned in the center of the composition
- **Spheres**: Multiple white spheres of varying sizes clustered together, creating an organic contrast against the rigid architecture
- **Floor Details**: Circular holes or rings cut into the white floor, featuring the RGB color scheme visible through them (red, blue, and green), creating visual connection between the walls and floor
- **Shadow casting**: Subtle shadows visible on the floor suggest directional lighting

## Lighting & Atmosphere
- **Primary light source**: Appears to come from above/front, creating clear shadows and dimension
- **Ambient lighting**: Warm, evenly distributed to maintain visibility throughout the scene
- **Color temperature**: Cool and modern aesthetic with high contrast between the saturated wall colors and neutral floor/ceiling

## Artistic Style
The scene exemplifies modern 3D design with its emphasis on primary colors, geometric forms, and clean composition—reminiscent of minimalist art and contemporary digital design practices.
