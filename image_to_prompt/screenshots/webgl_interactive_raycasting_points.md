# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a sophisticated 3D visualization featuring three undulating wave surfaces arranged in a staggered, layered composition against a pure black background. The scene demonstrates advanced use of three.js rendering capabilities with particular emphasis on volumetric geometry, lighting, and color gradients.

## Geometric Structure
- **Wave Surfaces**: Three parallel sinusoidal mesh surfaces that ripple and undulate in a coordinated pattern
- **Mesh Density**: Each surface is composed of a fine wireframe or vertex-heavy topology, creating visible geometric resolution and depth
- **Spatial Arrangement**: The surfaces are positioned at slightly offset depths, creating a sense of recession and layered perspective

## Color Scheme & Gradients
The visualization employs a striking **spectral color gradient**:
- **Left Section**: Deep crimson and red tones
- **Middle Section**: Vibrant lime and emerald green
- **Right Section**: Cyan and electric blue tones

This gradient flows smoothly across the entire composition, suggesting either a color-mapped height field or vertex-based color distribution.

## Lighting & Rendering
- **Emission/Glow**: The surfaces appear to have self-illumination or emissive material properties, creating a luminescent quality
- **Contrast**: The stark black background provides maximum contrast, making the neon-like colors pop dramatically
- **Specular Highlights**: Subtle reflective properties suggest the surfaces have some specularity

## Technical Aspects
This represents typical three.js visualization techniques ideal for:
- Scientific/mathematical data visualization
- Audio/music visualization
- Abstract 3D graphics
- Educational demonstrations of wave behavior
