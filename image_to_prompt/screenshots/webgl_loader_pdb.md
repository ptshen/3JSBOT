# 3D Molecular Structure Visualization

This is a three.js rendered scene displaying a complex organic molecule in three-dimensional space against a black background. Here's a detailed description:

## Molecular Composition
The molecule appears to be a heterocyclic compound containing:
- **Carbon atoms** (shown in black)
- **Nitrogen atoms** (shown in blue)
- **Oxygen atoms** (shown in red)
- **Hydrogen atoms** (shown in white/light gray)

## Structural Features
- **Central ring system**: The molecule features a fused multi-ring structure with nitrogen atoms integrated into the aromatic/heterocyclic framework
- **Bonds**: Chemical bonds are depicted as connecting lines between atoms, showing single and potentially double bond configurations
- **Spatial arrangement**: The atoms are positioned in a 3D coordinate system with clear depth perspective

## Visual Presentation
- **Atom rendering**: Each atom is represented as a sphere scaled proportionally to standard atomic sizes
- **Bond visualization**: Gray connecting lines represent covalent bonds
- **Labeling**: Hydrogen atoms are labeled with "H" text labels, and atoms are color-coded for easy identification
- **Lighting**: Subtle shading creates dimension and makes the molecular structure readable
- **Camera angle**: The molecule is presented at an angle that showcases the three-dimensional complexity of the structure

This type of visualization is commonly used in chemistry education and molecular visualization software for studying chemical structures and their spatial properties.
