# Three.js Brain MRI Sagittal Section - Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a medical imaging visualization depicting a **sagittal (side) cross-section of the human brain and skull**, rendered in grayscale against a pure black background. The rendering style suggests a sophisticated three.js implementation with realistic lighting and material properties.

## Anatomical Elements

### Skull Structure
- The **frontal bone** is visible at the anterior (front) portion
- The **occipital region** extends toward the posterior (back)
- Clear definition of the **cranial vault** housing the brain tissue
- Fine detail in the **jaw/mandible** structure at the anterior-inferior region

### Brain Anatomy
- **Cerebral hemispheres** dominate the upper/central portion with visible **gyri and sulci** (brain folds)
- The **brainstem** is distinctly outlined in the central inferior region
- **Cerebellum** appears to be rendered in the posterior-inferior area
- **Ventricular system** shows internal anatomical cavities

### Additional Structures
- **Nasal cavity** clearly depicted in the anterior region
- **Airway passages** visible in profile

## Rendering Qualities
- **Material realism**: Grayscale gradient with volumetric depth perception
- **Lighting**: Soft, diffused illumination creating subtle shadows and dimensional quality
- **Edge definition**: Sharp, crisp boundaries between tissue types
- **Contrast**: Excellent differentiation between bone (lighter) and soft tissue (darker)

This represents clinical-grade anatomical visualization, likely used for medical education or diagnostic purposes.
