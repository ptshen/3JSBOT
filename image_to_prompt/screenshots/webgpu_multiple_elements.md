# Three.js Scene Description

This screenshot displays a collection of six 3D rendered scenes, each presented in its own card-style container:

## Scene Breakdown:

**Scene 1 (Top Left):**
A simple solid blue rectangular prism or cube, rendered with flat shading against a light gray background. The geometry appears to be a basic box with minimal lighting complexity.

**Scene 2 (Top Center):**
A teal/cyan colored rectangular prism, similar in form to Scene 1 but with a slightly different color palette. This appears to be another fundamental 3D box geometry demonstrating basic material rendering.

**Scene 3 (Top Right):**
A polyhedron (appears to be an icosahedron or similar geometric shape) rendered with a yellow-green/lime color on one face and darker olive/brown tones on adjacent faces. This demonstrates faceted geometry with multi-directional lighting creating visible depth and shadow variation.

**Scene 4 (Bottom Left):**
A cyan/turquoise polyhedron with visible faceting and shading variations. The lighting reveals dimensional depth through color gradation from lighter turquoise to darker teal across different faces.

**Scene 5 (Bottom Center):**
A green cylindrical or columnar form with vertical segmentation, rendered with shading that creates a ribbed or fluted appearance. This demonstrates how lighting and geometry combine to create visual texture.

**Scene 6 (Bottom Right):**
A bright lime-green rectangular prism or box, rendered with clean, flat surfaces and consistent coloring.

The overall presentation suggests a tutorial or gallery showcasing basic three.js geometries and materials.
