# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
A vibrant neon-style 3D text rendering displaying the word "three.js" against a pure black background. The scene showcases advanced material and lighting techniques typical of WebGL demonstrations.

## Typography & Text Styling
- **Font**: Bold, modern sans-serif typeface with substantial thickness and depth
- **Text**: "three.js" rendered as 3D geometry with full volumetric properties
- **Scale**: Large, prominent, occupying the central portion of the viewport
- **Positioning**: Centered horizontally and vertically in the frame

## Lighting & Materials
- **Neon Effect**: Each letter features a distinct color with glowing neon aesthetics:
  - **"t"**: Warm yellow/gold with orange undertones
  - **"h"**: Yellow transitioning to lime green
  - **"r"**: Bright lime green
  - **"e" (first)**: Cyan/turquoise
  - **"e" (second)**: Cyan with slight green shift
  - **"j"**: Blue/purple gradient
  - **"s"**: Vibrant magenta/purple with pink accents

- **Glow/Bloom**: Pronounced luminous halos around each letter suggesting post-processing bloom effects
- **Surface Properties**: Appears to use emissive materials creating self-illuminating text

## Lighting Setup
- **Background**: Solid black void (RGB 0,0,0)
- **Light Sources**: Implied point lights or emissive materials creating the colored glow
- **Ambient**: Minimal ambient lighting, emphasizing contrast

## Technical Elements
This is a classic three.js showcase demonstrating:
- 3D text geometry generation
- Advanced material shading
- Bloom/post-processing effects
- Color gradients and transitions
- Professional neon aesthetic rendering
