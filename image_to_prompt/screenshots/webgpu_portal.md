# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a professionally rendered 3D medical visualization scene featuring a detailed human anatomical model against a sophisticated gradient background.

## Lighting & Environment
- **Background**: A smooth gradient transitioning from deep purple at the top to vibrant blue at the bottom, creating depth and visual appeal
- **Lighting Setup**: Carefully balanced lighting with what appears to be key lighting from the upper left, creating subtle shadows and dimensional modeling
- **Atmosphere**: Clean, professional medical/scientific visualization aesthetic with high contrast that makes the figure pop

## The Main Figure
- **Model**: A complete human anatomical skeleton/muscular system rendered in warm peachy-pink and coral tones
- **Detail Level**: High-fidelity anatomical accuracy showing:
  - Complete skeletal structure
  - Major muscle groups and anatomical systems
  - Transparent or semi-transparent rendering revealing internal structures
  - Proper anatomical proportions and posture
  
## Figure Positioning
- **Stance**: Standing upright in a neutral, slightly frontal pose
- **Scale**: Centered and appropriately sized to fill the composition without overcrowding
- **Pose**: Anatomically correct neutral standing position, ideal for educational/medical visualization

## Blurred Element
- A dark, out-of-focus hexagonal or crystalline structure in the background left, suggesting cellular or molecular structures, adding scientific context and depth

## Technical Quality
- Smooth surface rendering with realistic material properties
- Professional color grading and post-processing
- Strong depth of field effects
- Medical-grade visualization quality

This represents a premium medical education or healthcare application visualization.
