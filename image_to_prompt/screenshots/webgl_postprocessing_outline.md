# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a stylized, abstract 3D composition rendered in Three.js featuring a collection of geometric spheres and organic elements arranged on a flat surface against a black background.

## Key Elements

### Ground Plane
- A light gray/beige flat surface serving as the base, suggesting a simple ground or platform
- Creates a clear horizon line separating the scene from the black void background

### Spheres (Primary Objects)
The scene contains multiple spheres in varied sizes and colors:
- **Teal/Cyan sphere** - Large, positioned at the front-left of the composition
- **Bright green sphere** - Large, overlapping with the teal sphere, creating visual interest through intersection
- **Deep red/maroon sphere** - Large, positioned at the top-rear of the cluster
- **Yellow/olive spheres** - Medium-sized, positioned in the middle and upper regions
- **Purple spheres** - Small accent spheres scattered among larger forms
- **Small green accent sphere** - Tiny, placed distinctly among the larger masses

### Organic Elements
- **White/cream-colored branches** - Curved, organic plant-like forms extending upward and outward from the sphere cluster, creating a natural contrast to the geometric shapes
- These branches have a delicate, spiky quality with multiple thin extensions

## Lighting & Shading
- Soft, diffuse lighting creating smooth gradients across sphere surfaces
- Subtle shadows and highlights enhancing dimensionality
- No harsh shadows, suggesting ambient or soft directional lighting

## Overall Aesthetic
The scene evokes a playful, minimalist aesthetic—suggesting themes of growth, harmony between geometric and organic forms, or abstract molecular/cellular concepts.
