# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a stunning architectural visualization of a grand **neoclassical or baroque dome interior**, captured with a characteristic wide-angle or fisheye perspective that emphasizes the verticality and grandeur of the space.

## Architectural Elements

**Dome Structure:**
- A magnificent coffered ceiling dome dominates the upper portion
- The dome features a circular oculus (central opening) at its apex, allowing warm light to flood the interior
- The coffers (recessed panels) create rhythmic geometric patterns that draw the eye upward

**Walls & Galleries:**
- Multiple tiers of ornate galleries and arched openings
- Tall arched windows distribute soft, golden-warm illumination throughout
- Classical columns and pilasters define the vertical rhythm
- Ornamental moldings and architectural details add richness and complexity

## Lighting
- Warm, golden-hour lighting (likely procedurally generated warm color temperature)
- Primary light source from the upper oculus creates a luminous focal point
- Secondary light from side windows creates depth and reveals architectural details
- Subtle ambient occlusion and shadows enhance three-dimensional form

## Material & Texture Quality
- High-fidelity stone and marble textures with subtle wear and aging
- Realistic specularity on architectural surfaces
- Warm patina suggesting aged masonry or gilded surfaces

## Technical Execution
The scene demonstrates professional three.js implementation with impressive depth-of-field effects, fisheye distortion, and sophisticated lighting calculations.
