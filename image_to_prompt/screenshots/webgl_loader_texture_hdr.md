# Three.js Scene Description: Classical Dome Interior

## Overall Composition
This is a stunning architectural visualization of a classical domed interior space, rendered with exceptional attention to realistic lighting and material properties. The scene captures the grandeur of neoclassical or baroque ecclesiastical architecture, likely inspired by historic cathedral or basilica interiors.

## Architectural Elements

**Central Dome**
- A magnificent octagonal or circular dome dominates the upper portion of the scene
- Features a coffered ceiling with geometric recesses creating depth and shadow
- Illuminated oculus (circular opening) at the apex serves as a natural light source, creating a warm, heavenly glow
- The dome's curvature is meticulously rendered with subtle lighting gradations

**Walls and Structure**
- Ornate architectural detailing with classical moldings and cornices
- Multiple arched alcoves or niches visible along the walls
- Warm golden-brown tonality suggesting aged marble or stone surfaces
- Architectural ribbing and segmented divisions creating vertical emphasis

## Lighting
- Warm, directional light floods through the upper oculus
- Strategic use of ambient illumination from the dome's opening
- Realistic specular highlights on architectural surfaces
- Subtle shadows enhancing three-dimensional depth and form

## Technical Achievement
- Sophisticated material rendering with proper specularity and roughness
- Effective use of normal mapping for architectural detail
- Atmospheric perspective with subtle color warmth
- Fish-eye or wide-angle perspective creating immersive spatial awareness

This represents professional-grade architectural visualization suitable for heritage documentation or immersive virtual heritage applications.
