# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This scene displays two identical 3D rendered rectangular boxes positioned side-by-side against a dark gray background. The boxes are arranged horizontally with balanced spacing between them.

## Box Design
Each box features a **horizontal striped pattern** with four distinct colored bands stacked vertically:

1. **Top band**: Light gray/silver metallic material with subtle specular highlights
2. **Second band**: Vibrant blue (primary blue)
3. **Third band**: Bright lime green
4. **Bottom band**: Vivid red

## 3D Effects & Materials
- **Lighting**: Three-point lighting setup creates visible shadows and depth on the right faces of each box
- **Material properties**: The boxes appear to use Phong or Standard materials with:
  - Slight specular highlights on the metallic gray stripe
  - Matte finish on the colored bands
  - Realistic shadowing indicating directional light source from the upper left

## Perspective & Depth
- The boxes are rendered with slight perspective distortion, suggesting an isometric or near-isometric viewing angle
- Dark shadows cast beneath each box enhance the sense of elevation and three-dimensionality
- The right edges are darker, indicating side-facing surfaces receiving less light

## Purpose
This appears to be a demonstration of multi-material rendering or material property comparison in three.js, showcasing how different surface properties and colors render identically across duplicated geometry.
