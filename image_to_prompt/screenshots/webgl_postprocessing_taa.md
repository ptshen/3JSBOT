# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist 3D visualization displaying two distinct geometric objects positioned side-by-side against a pure black background, creating a stark, clinical presentation typical of technical or architectural visualization.

## Left Object: Wireframe Cube
- **Geometry**: A perfectly proportioned cube rendered in **wireframe mode**
- **Material**: White/light gray lines with no fill
- **Structure**: All edges and internal diagonal lines are visible, showing the complete geometric skeleton
- **Style**: Technical, schematic appearance suggesting structural analysis or geometric study
- **Dimensions**: Medium-sized, occupying roughly the left third of the composition

## Right Object: Textured Cube
- **Geometry**: A cube matching the scale and proportions of the left object
- **Material**: **Brick/masonry texture** in warm terracotta and orange tones
- **Surface**: Solid filled geometry with photorealistic brick pattern showing individual bricks with mortar lines
- **Style**: Realistic, architectural material representation
- **Dimensions**: Equal size to the wireframe cube, creating visual balance

## Lighting & Atmosphere
- **Background**: Pure black (RGB 0,0,0) providing maximum contrast
- **Lighting**: Neutral three-point or ambient lighting that flatly illuminates both objects
- **Shadows**: Minimal to none, emphasizing clarity and form

## Design Intent
This scene appears to be a **before-and-after or concept-to-reality comparison**, showcasing the transformation from abstract geometric wireframe to textured, material-applied 3D model—a common pedagogical or demonstrative tool in 3D modeling workflows.
