# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist three.js scene featuring a linear arrangement of four spherical objects against a pure black background, creating a stark, high-contrast composition that emphasizes the geometric forms.

## Spheres and Materials
- **Four spheres** are arranged along a horizontal axis, progressively increasing in size from left to right
- Each sphere exhibits a **gradient material** with a vibrant color transition from **magenta/pink** at the bottom to **blue/cyan** at the top
- The spheres appear to have a **glossy or metallic finish**, with visible highlights suggesting realistic lighting and reflectivity
- The spheres maintain consistent spacing, creating a rhythmic visual progression

## Lighting and Atmosphere
- **Single light source** positioned slightly above and to the right, creating soft highlights on the upper portions of each sphere
- **Soft shadows** cast beneath each sphere, grounding them in the scene
- The dramatic black void background emphasizes the luminescence of the gradient materials
- Low ambient light enhances the contrast and makes the spheres appear to glow

## Technical Elements
- A subtle **horizontal reference line** extends across the scene, likely indicating a ground plane or axis guide
- The positioning suggests a **linear motion or progression**, possibly representing data visualization, particle systems, or stages of transformation
- Clean, modern aesthetic typical of contemporary generative or data-driven 3D art
