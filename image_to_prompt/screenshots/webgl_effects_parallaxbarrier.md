# 3D Scene Description: Urban Courtyard with Reflective Spheres

## Overall Composition
This is a three.js rendered scene depicting an Italian-style urban courtyard viewed from a ground-level perspective, flooded with numerous reflective metallic spheres of varying sizes scattered throughout the space.

## Architectural Elements

**Background & Walls:**
- Warm, ochre/terracotta-colored building facades on both sides and rear
- Classical European architecture with regular window placements
- The buildings frame a narrow courtyard space, creating an intimate urban environment
- Textured wall surfaces suggesting aged plaster or stone

**Perspective:**
- Low vantage point emphasizing the depth of the courtyard
- Receding perspective draws the viewer's eye toward the back of the space
- Creates a sense of enclosure while maintaining visual depth

## Lighting & Materials

**Reflective Spheres:**
- Polished chrome/metallic material with mirror-like reflectivity
- Highly specular surfaces reflecting the surrounding environment
- Spheres range from large (foreground) to very small (background)
- Create focal points of bright highlights and environmental reflections

**Overall Lighting:**
- Warm, diffused ambient light suggesting daytime (golden hour quality)
- Light warmth complements the terracotta building tones
- Soft shadows indicate global illumination rendering
- High-quality reflections suggest physically-based rendering (PBR)

## Visual Effect
The contrast between the static, warm architectural geometry and the dynamic, reflective spheres creates visual interest, demonstrating advanced material and lighting capabilities in three.js.
