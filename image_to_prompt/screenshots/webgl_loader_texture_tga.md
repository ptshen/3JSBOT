# 3D Scene Description

This is a minimalist three.js scene featuring two wooden crates positioned side by side against a black background.

## Scene Elements:

**Left Crate (Dark/Gray):**
- Constructed with a dark gray or charcoal wood texture
- Features vertical wood grain detail suggesting weathered or aged timber
- A diagonal black line or crease runs from the top-left to bottom-right, suggesting either a shadow, seam, or structural detail
- Cube-shaped geometry with clean, sharp edges
- Positioned on the left side of the composition

**Right Crate (Light/Brown):**
- Rendered with a lighter, warm tan or natural wood finish
- Similar construction with visible wood grain texture
- Matches the left crate with a diagonal line running from top-left to bottom-right
- Identical cube geometry and scale
- Positioned to the right, creating a symmetrical composition

## Lighting & Rendering:
- Soft, diffuse lighting that evenly illuminates both crates
- Subtle shadows and highlights enhance the 3D form and wood texture
- Black background with no visible ground plane, emphasizing the crates as the sole subjects
- Clean, professional rendering typical of product visualization or game asset display

The scene appears to be a texture/material comparison study or game asset showcase, demonstrating two wood material variations on identical geometry.
