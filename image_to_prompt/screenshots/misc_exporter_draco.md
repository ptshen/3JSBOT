# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a clean, minimalist 3D rendering featuring a striking bright lime-green abstract sculptural form positioned against a neutral backdrop.

## Primary Object
The main subject is a **smooth, organic knot-like structure** with the following characteristics:
- **Color**: Vibrant neon lime green (#00FF00 or similar)
- **Form**: A continuous, interlocking ribbon or tube that creates a trefoil knot or similar topological structure
- **Surface**: Highly polished with smooth shading, suggesting a glossy material with good specular highlights
- **Geometry**: Appears to be a parametrically generated surface with flowing curves and loops that interweave

## Lighting & Shadows
- **Illumination**: Professional 3-point lighting setup with key light creating highlights on the upper surfaces
- **Shadow**: A soft, diffuse gray shadow cast beneath the object, adding depth and grounding the sculpture
- **Ambient lighting**: Sufficient to illuminate the interior curves and shadowed areas without harsh contrast

## Environment
- **Background**: Neutral mid-gray (#808080 approximately)
- **Ground Plane**: Light gray/white gradient surface
- **Composition**: The object is centered with generous negative space, emphasizing the form

## Rendering Quality
- Clean anti-aliasing
- Realistic material properties with Phong or PBR shading
- Professional presentation suitable for product visualization or artistic showcase
