# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a sleek, contemporary 3D rendering featuring a minimalist sculptural bust set against a vibrant gradient background. The scene exemplifies modern digital art aesthetics with its bold color palette and clean presentation.

## Subject - The Bust
- **Form**: A smooth, featureless human head and shoulders sculpture
- **Geometry**: Highly polished surfaces with subtle anatomical definition
- **Expression**: Serene and neutral, facing directly forward
- **Scale**: Prominently centered, filling approximately 40% of the frame

## Lighting & Materials
- **Material Properties**: High specularity and reflectivity suggesting a glossy, almost plastic or ceramic finish
- **Lighting Setup**: Sophisticated three-point or gradient lighting system
- **Reflections**: Visible specular highlights on the crown and shoulder areas indicating directional key lighting

## Color Palette & Atmosphere
- **Primary Colors**: 
  - Cyan/turquoise (cooler tones on the figure)
  - Magenta/purple (warmer accent lighting)
  - Hot pink (gradient background)
- **Gradient Background**: A radial or linear gradient transitioning from purple at the edges to pink toward the center
- **Color Temperature**: Creates a vibrant, neon-like cyberpunk aesthetic

## Technical Elements
- **Rendering Quality**: High polygon count with smooth shading
- **Anti-aliasing**: Clean edges and minimal artifacts
- **Depth of Field**: Appears slightly soft, emphasizing the subject
- **Shadows**: Subtle shadowing beneath the bust adds dimensionality

This is quintessential contemporary digital sculpture—clean, minimalist, and visually striking.
