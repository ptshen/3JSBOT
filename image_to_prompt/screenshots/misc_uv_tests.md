# Three.js 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a geometric visualization titled "new THREE.PlaneGeometry(100, 100, 4, 4)" displaying a 4×4 subdivided plane mesh rendered in an isometric perspective view.

## Structural Elements

**Grid Layout:**
- The scene shows a 4×4 grid of square subdivisions creating 16 total quadrants
- Each square is numbered sequentially (0-15) in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom arrangement
- The plane appears to be divided by both horizontal and vertical lines creating the subdivision structure

**Visual Characteristics:**
- **Diagonal lines:** Each subdivided square contains a diagonal line running from the lower-left to upper-right corner, likely representing the triangulation of the plane geometry
- **Color scheme:** Minimalist white/light gray background with dark gray or black lines for the geometry
- **Numbering system:** Each cell is labeled with its corresponding index number in a light gray or subdued color

## Perspective and Rendering
- The view is tilted at approximately 45 degrees, creating an isometric or three-point perspective effect
- The plane appears flat but is positioned to show depth and dimensional understanding
- All edges and subdivisions are clearly visible with clean, crisp line rendering

## Technical Context
This appears to be a debugging or educational visualization showing how Three.js's `PlaneGeometry` with parameters (100, 100, 4, 4) subdivides a plane into segments—useful for developers learning about mesh geometry or testing plane generation parameters.
