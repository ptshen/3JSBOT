# 3D Scene Description

## Lighting & Atmosphere
The scene is dominated by a **warm, golden-amber ambient lighting** that creates a moody, evening-like atmosphere. A strong **directional light source** (likely positioned above and to the left) casts sharp shadows across the floor, creating a dramatic interplay of light and shadow that emphasizes depth and dimension.

## Floor
The ground plane is a **wooden surface with a herringbone or parquet pattern**, rendered with realistic wood grain textures and subtle variations in tone. The floor reflects light realistically, with bright highlights where the light strikes most directly, creating a polished, slightly glossy appearance.

## Objects
Three distinct objects are scattered across the wooden floor:

1. **Left-center**: A dark **cubic or rectangular box** with sharp edges, appearing as a simple geometric form
2. **Center**: A brighter area with a **spherical or rounded object** catching the light, creating a prominent highlight
3. **Right**: Another dark **geometric shape**, possibly cubic, casting its own distinct shadow

## Composition & Depth
- The objects are positioned at varying distances, creating good spatial depth
- Shadows extend dramatically across the floor, emphasizing the direction and quality of the light source
- The arrangement creates a sense of scale and three-dimensional space
- The dark background isolates the scene, focusing attention on the illuminated floor and objects

This appears to be a **classical 3D lighting study or product visualization setup**, demonstrating effective use of shadows and reflections to create visual interest and depth.
