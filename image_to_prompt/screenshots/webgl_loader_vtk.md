# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist 3D scene rendered in Three.js against a pure black background, featuring four geometric objects arranged horizontally across the upper portion of the viewport.

## Objects

### 1. White Rabbit (Left)
- A stylized 3D model of a white rabbit or bunny
- Positioned on the far left
- Features a simplified, polygonal art style
- Appears to be in a sitting or resting pose
- Serves as the focal point introducing the scene

### 2. Green Cube (Center-Left)
- A bright, saturated lime/neon green rectangular prism
- Positioned second from the left
- Clean, unlit appearance with flat shading
- Primary color: RGB(0, 255, 0) or similar

### 3. Blue Cube (Center-Right)
- A vivid, pure blue rectangular solid
- Positioned third from the left
- Matches the scale and style of the green cube
- Primary color: RGB(0, 0, 255) or similar

### 4. Red Cube (Right)
- A bright red rectangular prism
- Positioned on the far right
- Consistent with the scale and presentation of the other cubes
- Primary color: RGB(255, 0, 0) or similar

## Lighting & Style
- Minimal or flat lighting with no apparent shadows
- Clean, posterized aesthetic
- No visible reflections or complex material properties
- Likely using basic Three.js materials (MeshBasicMaterial or similar)

This appears to be a demonstration scene showcasing basic 3D modeling and color rendering capabilities.
