# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist three.js scene featuring a large geometric surface set against a soft, gradient sky background. The perspective creates a sense of depth and scale, with the viewer positioned as if looking down a vast, tilted plane.

## Primary Elements

### Main Surface
- **Shape**: A large trapezoid/pentagon-like platform viewed from an isometric or perspective angle
- **Material**: Light blue/cyan colored surface with subtle gradient shading
- **Edges**: Clean, metallic gray borders that define the platform's perimeter
- **Texture**: Appears smooth and flat with soft lighting that creates gentle shadow gradients

### Particle Elements
- **Quantity**: Approximately 15-20 golden/yellow spheres scattered across the surface
- **Distribution**: Randomly distributed across the blue plane, with higher concentration toward the center and right side
- **Size**: Varying scales, ranging from small to medium spheres
- **Material**: Reflective, metallic appearance with warm yellow-gold coloring
- **Lighting**: Each sphere receives specular highlights, suggesting a point light source

## Background
- **Sky**: Soft gradient transitioning from warm peachy tones in the upper left to cool blue-gray tones
- **Atmosphere**: Hazy, diffused lighting suggesting an overcast or ethereal environment

## Lighting & Mood
- Clean, modern aesthetic
- Professional, possibly UI/UX or data visualization context
- Calm, contemplative atmosphere enhanced by cool color palette
