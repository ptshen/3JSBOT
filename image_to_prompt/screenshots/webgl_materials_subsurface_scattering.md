# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist three.js scene featuring a single stylized 3D character rendered against a pure black background, creating a dramatic spotlight effect that emphasizes the subject.

## Main Subject: Stylized Rabbit/Bunny Character
- **Form**: A rotund, organic bunny figure with soft, rounded proportions
- **Posture**: The character is positioned in a sitting or crouching pose, slightly tilted
- **Ears**: Two prominent ears extend upward and outward, with the left ear appearing more prominent and angular
- **Body**: A bulbous, egg-like torso with subtle anatomical curves suggesting a cute, cartoonish design

## Material & Lighting Properties
- **Primary Color Palette**: Warm golden-yellow to peachy-orange gradient
- **Surface Finish**: Appears to have a matte or semi-glossy material with:
  - Lighter, warmer tones on the front-facing surfaces (yellows and golds)
  - Darker, reddish-brown shadows on the sides and back of the form
  - Subtle ambient occlusion creating depth in crevices
- **Lighting Setup**: Single or primary light source from the upper-left, creating dimensional modeling with warm highlights and cooler shadow areas

## Atmosphere
- Clean, isolated presentation typical of product visualization or character portfolio work
- The black background creates maximum contrast, allowing focus on the form and material properties
- Professional rendering quality with smooth geometry and carefully calibrated material properties

This appears to be a character asset or design study, possibly for a game or animated project.
