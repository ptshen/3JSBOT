# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is an interior architectural visualization of a deteriorating industrial or residential space rendered in Three.js. The scene employs realistic lighting and material properties to convey an abandoned or under-construction aesthetic.

## Environmental Elements

**Lighting:**
- Prominent natural light source streaming through a transom window positioned high on the far wall
- Soft, diffused daylight creating strong contrast between illuminated and shadowed areas
- Warm, golden hour-like atmospheric quality suggesting either early morning or late afternoon
- Global illumination creating realistic ambient occlusion in corners and crevices

**Walls & Structure:**
- Weathered, darkened wall surfaces with visible discoloration and aging
- Concrete or plaster materiality with mottled texturing suggesting decay or heavy use
- Vertical wall divisions creating geometric segmentation
- Exposed ceiling with visible structural elements and darkened surface patina

## Architectural Features

**Window:**
- Large transom-style window divided into rectangular panes
- Positioned centrally on the upper portion of the far wall
- Provides the primary light source for the entire scene
- Frames an exterior view with visible sky and distant landscape elements

**Flooring:**
- Concrete floor with visible wear patterns, staining, and debris
- Slight surface irregularities and dust accumulation suggesting abandonment

**Fixtures:**
- Counter or work surface visible in the lower left corner
- Minimal furnishings, emphasizing the sparse, utilitarian nature of the space

## Material & Mood
The rendering demonstrates sophisticated material handling with realistic surface degradation, dust accumulation, and light interaction typical of professional architectural visualization, conveying a narrative of urban decay or renovation.
