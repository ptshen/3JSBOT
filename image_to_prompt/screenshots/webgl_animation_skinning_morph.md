## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist three.js scene featuring a small, stylized robot character positioned in the center of a neutral, light gray environment.

## Character Design
The robot has a distinctive, charming aesthetic with:

**Head/Sensor Unit:**
- A rectangular, boxy design with a golden/mustard yellow primary color
- Two circular dark gray or black optical sensors/cameras mounted on top
- A horizontal black accent stripe running across the upper portion
- Clean, geometric proportions suggesting a futuristic aesthetic

**Body:**
- A compact, rounded rectangular torso in matching golden yellow
- Segmented articulation suggesting joints and mechanical construction
- Dark gray accent panels on the sides

**Limbs:**
- Stubby, proportionally short legs with defined knee joints
- A squat stance that gives the character a cute, approachable appearance
- Angular geometry consistent with the overall mechanical design

## Lighting & Environment
- **Lighting:** Soft, even illumination with subtle shadows beneath the robot, suggesting a key light positioned above
- **Background:** Clean, neutral light gray gradient
- **Ground Plane:** Subtle horizon line dividing the composition, creating depth

## Overall Aesthetic
