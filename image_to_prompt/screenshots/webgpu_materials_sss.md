# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist three.js scene featuring a single stylized 3D character rendered against a pure black background, creating a dramatic spotlight effect that emphasizes the subject.

## The Character
The central object is a **cartoonish rabbit or bunny figure** with a charming, low-poly aesthetic:

- **Body**: Rendered in warm, peachy-orange tones with soft gradient shading, suggesting rounded geometry
- **Head**: Positioned at an angle, giving the character personality and an engaging pose
- **Ears**: Two prominent yellow ears extending upward from the head, appearing bright and contrasting against the warmer body tones
- **Posture**: The character appears to be in a sitting or crouching position, viewed from a three-quarter angle

## Lighting & Materials
- **Lighting Setup**: Warm, ambient lighting with subtle shadows creates dimensional depth
- **Material Properties**: The character uses a combination of diffuse materials with slight glossiness, giving it a soft, toy-like quality
- **Color Palette**: Warm oranges, peachy tones, and yellow highlights create an inviting, friendly atmosphere

## Technical Execution
- Clean, anti-aliased rendering typical of three.js
- Efficient polygon count suggesting real-time rendering capability
- Professional depth-of-field or camera positioning that keeps the subject in sharp focus

This appears to be a character asset demonstration or portfolio piece showcasing 3D modeling and rendering capabilities.
