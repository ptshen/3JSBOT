# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
A digitally rendered heart shape composed of countless glowing pink particles against a deep burgundy/maroon gradient background. The scene demonstrates advanced particle system rendering with sophisticated lighting effects.

## Technical Elements

**Particle System:**
- Approximately 2,000-5,000 individual glowing spheres or point lights
- Each particle emits a soft, radiant glow creating a luminous halo effect
- Particles are positioned to form the outline and structure of a stylized heart
- The density varies slightly, with tighter clustering around the curves and peaks of the heart shape

**Lighting & Materials:**
- Bright magenta/hot pink (#FF00FF to #FF1493 range) particle coloration
- Each particle has a bloom or glow post-processing effect
- Soft light scattering creates a dreamy, ethereal quality
- The particles appear semi-transparent with additive blending

**Environment:**
- Deep burgundy to dark purple gradient background
- Subtle vignetting darkens the edges of the frame
- Smooth, featureless backdrop emphasizing the heart as the focal point
- No environmental geometry or additional objects

## Mood & Aesthetic
Romantic, ethereal, and modern—perfect for Valentine's Day themes, love-related applications, or emotional digital art installations. The particle-based construction creates a sense of energy and flow while maintaining the recognizable heart symbol.
