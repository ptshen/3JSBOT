# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist 3D rendered scene featuring two stylized humanoid figures positioned against a gradient background that transitions from deep teal/cyan at the bottom to dark purple/indigo at the top.

## Lighting & Environment
- **Background**: Smooth gradient backdrop creating depth and atmosphere
- **Lighting**: Clean, even illumination with subtle ambient lighting that highlights the figures' geometry
- **Ground Plane**: Reflective surface beneath the figures showing mirror-like reflections, suggesting a polished floor with high specularity

## Character Models (Left Figure)
- **Appearance**: Orange/coral-colored character with a glossy material
- **Build**: Compact, blocky geometric construction typical of low-poly 3D models
- **Pose**: Standing upright with hands on hips, conveying confidence
- **Details**: Smooth, rounded forms with minimal facial definition

## Character Models (Right Figure)
- **Appearance**: Brown/tan-colored character with similar geometric proportions
- **Attire**: Appears to be wearing striped or patterned clothing (burgundy/maroon tones)
- **Pose**: Mirror stance to the left figure, also hands-on-hips
- **Definition**: Comparable level of detail and stylization to the left figure

## Visual Style
This scene exemplifies modern web-based 3D graphics with:
- Clean, minimalist aesthetic
- Procedural or simple material systems
- Emphasis on form over detailed texturing
- Professional rendering suitable for web applications, games, or digital interfaces
