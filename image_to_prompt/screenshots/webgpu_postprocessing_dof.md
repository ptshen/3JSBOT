# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a symmetrical, kaleidoscopic fractal visualization with radial mirror symmetry about the central axis. The scene employs a dark, immersive aesthetic with vibrant neon color gradients against deep blacks.

## Color Palette
- **Primary Colors**: Deep magentas, hot pinks, and electric purples dominate the composition
- **Secondary Colors**: Teal and cyan accents provide cool counterpoints
- **Tertiary Elements**: Burnt orange and warm amber tones in the outer periphery
- **Background**: Near-black void creating dramatic contrast and depth

## Structural Elements

### Central Region
- A dark green vertical column forms the symmetry axis
- Highly detailed fractal-like geometry with recursive patterns
- Appears to be procedurally generated or based on mathematical formulas

### Mid-Range Structure
- Spherical or bulbous forms arranged in symmetrical patterns
- Gradient lighting transitions from purple to magenta to pink
- Multiple "nodes" or focal points radiating outward

### Peripheral Areas
- Warm tones (orange, amber) fade into the darkness
- Textured, organic surface details suggesting complex geometry
- Maintains the 8-fold or higher rotational symmetry

## Lighting & Effects
- Non-photorealistic neon glow aesthetic
- Possibly using emissive materials and bloom effects
- Ambient lighting that emphasizes the surreal, abstract nature
- Strong rim lighting on geometric edges

## Overall Mood
Psychedelic, abstract, and otherworldly—evoking digital surrealism or visualization of mathematical/quantum phenomena.
