# Three.js Scene Description

## Lighting and Composition
This is a sophisticated demonstration of **lunar phase rendering** or **sphere lighting progression**. The scene showcases a methodical study of how spheres respond to directional lighting as it shifts across their surfaces.

## Visual Elements

**Upper Row (Approximately 10 spheres):**
- Displays spheres transitioning from completely dark/unlit on the left to progressively illuminated
- The lighting appears to sweep across from left to right
- Final spheres on the right show full illumination with visible specular highlights
- Demonstrates the "new moon" to "full moon" lighting progression

**Lower Row (Approximately 12 spheres):**
- A similar progression, slightly offset or showing a complementary lighting angle
- Provides comparison or shows multiple light source interactions
- The spheres maintain consistent material properties (likely Phong or PBR material with metallic or matte finish)

## Technical Aspects

**Materials & Shading:**
- Spheres appear to have a **matte to semi-glossy finish**
- Soft shadow regions indicate **soft shadows** are enabled
- Clear **specular highlights** on fully lit spheres suggest realistic material properties

**Lighting Setup:**
- Single or primary **directional light source** sweeping position
- **Soft ambient lighting** preventing complete black in shadow regions
- Possible secondary fill light for subtle illumination in dark areas

**Environment:**
- Pure black background isolating the geometric subjects
- No visible ground plane or additional geometry
- Minimalist aesthetic emphasizing the mathematical and lighting principles

This is a classic educational visualization commonly used to demonstrate **3D graphics fundamentals**: sphere geometry, normal mapping, light-surface interactions, and material properties.
