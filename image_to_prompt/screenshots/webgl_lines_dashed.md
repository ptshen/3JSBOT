# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist three.js scene rendered against a pure black background, featuring a single geometric object positioned in the upper-center area of the viewport.

## Primary Object
**Main Element:** A wireframe cube or box structure with 4 subdivisions creating a 2x2 grid pattern on its visible face.

**Visual Characteristics:**
- **Material:** Golden/amber-colored wireframe edges with minimal fill
- **Structure:** The object appears to be a box with internal subdivisions, creating four distinct rectangular compartments arranged in a 2x2 matrix
- **Rendering Style:** Clean line-based geometry typical of three.js wireframe rendering
- **Bounding Box:** An orange/golden dashed rectangular outline frames the entire structure

## Lighting & Atmosphere
- **Background:** Pure black (#000000), creating stark contrast
- **Lighting:** Subtle ambient lighting reveals the 3D structure and depth
- **Shadow/Depth:** Minimal shading suggests either flat lighting or orthographic projection

## Technical Notes
- The scene demonstrates classic three.js wireframe visualization
- The perspective suggests either an orthographic camera or wide-angle view
- The object appears stationary with no apparent animation
- Clean, technical aesthetic suitable for architectural visualization, UI design, or product mockups

This appears to be a blueprint-style or technical visualization, possibly representing a grid layout, storage system, or modular component design.
