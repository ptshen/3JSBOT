# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist three.js scene featuring a single rectangular object centered in the viewport against a pure black background. The stark contrast creates a focused, gallery-like presentation.

## The Object
**Appearance:**
- A vertical rectangular plane or card-like geometry positioned in the center of the scene
- Dimensions suggest a portrait orientation (taller than wide)
- The surface displays a vibrant floral pattern featuring pink roses and green foliage

**Texture Details:**
- The texture appears to be a high-resolution botanical or decorative pattern
- Predominantly pink and coral tones with natural green leaves
- The pattern suggests a repeating tile or wallpaper design
- Soft, organic imagery with realistic flower rendering

## Lighting & Materials
- Even, neutral lighting that illuminates the textured surface uniformly
- Matte or slightly diffuse material finish (no obvious specularity or reflections)
- No visible shadows or depth cues, suggesting orthographic or simple perspective rendering

## Camera & Composition
- Frontal, perpendicular view of the object
- Perfectly centered in the frame
- Ample negative space surrounding the object
- Clean, symmetrical composition typical of product showcase or art presentation scenarios

## Technical Aspects
The scene demonstrates efficient three.js usage with minimal geometry complexity—suitable for web-based 3D applications prioritizing performance and aesthetic simplicity.
