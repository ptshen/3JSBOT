# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Aesthetic
This is a minimalist, atmospheric 3D scene characterized by a serene and ethereal quality. The composition evokes a sense of calm and contemplation through its use of soft gradients and subtle lighting.

## Lighting & Atmosphere
- **Primary Light Source**: A soft, glowing orb positioned near the center-top of the composition, appearing as a pale sun or moon
- **Ambient Lighting**: Extremely soft, diffuse illumination that creates a hazy, foggy atmosphere
- **Color Palette**: Dominated by cool tones transitioning from pale blue-grey at the top to warmer mauve and dusty rose tones toward the horizon
- **Atmospheric Effects**: Heavy use of atmospheric perspective or fog, creating a dreamlike quality with minimal contrast

## Composition
- **Horizon Line**: Centered approximately in the middle of the frame, creating a balanced symmetry
- **Depth**: Very shallow depth of field or minimal geometric complexity - the scene appears almost abstract
- **Perspective**: Likely an orthographic or extremely wide-angle view with minimal depth cues

## Technical Characteristics
- **Geometry**: Minimal or potentially just a skybox/background
- **Shaders**: Likely using gradient or atmospheric shaders for the smooth color transitions
- **Anti-aliasing**: Smooth, with no visible artifacts or jagged edges
- **Resolution**: High quality with soft, seamless gradients

This scene exemplifies a "zen" approach to 3D visualization, prioritizing mood and simplicity over geometric complexity.
