# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a professionally rendered 3D head model displayed against a neutral gray background, characteristic of a three.js WebGL rendering environment. The scene demonstrates clean, studio-quality lighting and texturing suitable for character development, game assets, or medical visualization.

## Head Model Details

**Geometry & Structure:**
- A stylized human head with smooth, simplified facial geometry
- Bald, featureless scalp with subtle surface curvature
- Neutral, androgynous facial features
- Closed lips with minimal definition
- Defined cheekbones and jawline
- Proportionally realistic head-to-neck ratio

**Materials & Surface Properties:**
- Smooth, matte white/light gray material with subtle specularity
- Slight surface imperfections suggesting a realistic skin shader
- Minimal surface detail, indicating either a low-poly aesthetic or aggressive normal map smoothing
- Uniform coloring across the entire model

## Lighting
- Three-point lighting setup creating dimensional form
- Key light from the upper-left producing soft shadows on the right side
- Fill light preventing harsh shadow areas
- Specular highlights on the eyes and forehead suggesting glossy eye surfaces
- Soft, diffused lighting typical of portrait rendering

## Camera & Perspective
- Three-quarter view angle (approximately 45 degrees)
- Eye-level framing
- Slight downward tilt focusing viewer attention on facial features

**Technical Context:** This appears to be a base mesh or development stage for character modeling, commonly used in game development, VFX, or digital human projects.
