# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
A minimalist 3D scene rendered against a dark charcoal gray background, featuring three isometric cube objects positioned at different points in the viewport.

## Objects

### 1. **Green Cube (Top-Left)**
- **Position**: Upper left quadrant of the screen
- **Color**: Bright lime/neon green (#00FF00 or similar)
- **Style**: Appears to have a semi-transparent or gradient effect, with visible depth showing multiple faces
- **Rotation**: Isometric angle, tilted to show three visible faces
- **Size**: Medium-small scale

### 2. **Orange Cube (Bottom-Left)**
- **Position**: Lower left area of the viewport
- **Color**: Warm orange (#FF8800 or similar)
- **Style**: Solid appearance with clear 3D geometry
- **Rotation**: Isometric perspective matching the green cube
- **Size**: Slightly smaller than the green cube

### 3. **Gold/Brown Cube (Center-Right)**
- **Position**: Approximate center-right of the screen
- **Color**: Muted golden-brown or olive tone
- **Style**: Darker, more saturated appearance
- **Rotation**: Similar isometric angle to other cubes
- **Size**: Comparable to the green cube

## UI Elements
- **Text Labels**: "reset" and "exit" appear in light blue text
- **Exit Button**: A red rectangular button with white "exit" text positioned near the gold cube
- **Typography**: Clean, sans-serif font

## Lighting & Rendering
- **Lighting**: Appears to use simple directional or ambient lighting with clear shadow/depth definition on cube faces
- **Shading**: Each cube shows distinct face coloring, suggesting basic 3D face differentiation
- **Overall Tone**: High contrast between vibrant colored objects and dark background

This appears to be a UI for an interactive application or game, possibly demonstrating basic three.js 3D rendering capabilities with interactive controls.
