# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a layered 3D text visualization rendered with three.js, featuring three instances of the same text arranged in a stacked composition against a neutral light gray background.

## Text Elements
- **Content**: All three layers display the text "Three.js" (top and middle layers) and "Simple text." (bottom layer)
- **Font**: The text uses a clean, sans-serif typeface with medium weight
- **Positioning**: The text instances are offset both horizontally and vertically, creating a cascading or staggered effect

## Visual Styling
- **Color Scheme**: 
  - Top layer: Light cyan/turquoise outline
  - Middle layer: Medium blue with slight transparency
  - Bottom layer: Lighter blue-gray tone
  
- **Transparency**: Each layer exhibits varying levels of opacity, creating a translucent, ghosting effect that allows visibility of overlapping text

- **Rendering**: Wireframe or outline-style rendering is applied, giving the text a technical, architectural quality typical of three.js demonstration content

## Depth & Perspective
- The layers appear to recede slightly into the background
- The overlapping arrangement creates subtle depth perception
- No obvious 3D rotation or perspective distortion is applied to individual text elements

## Overall Aesthetic
This appears to be a demonstration or tutorial showcase of three.js text rendering capabilities, emphasizing layer management, transparency blending, and basic 3D text manipulation.
