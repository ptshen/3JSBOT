# Detailed Scene Description

## Overall Setup
This is a professional 3D rendering scene demonstrating lighting and material properties in Three.js. The composition features a controlled studio-like environment with a neutral gray surface and carefully positioned lighting.

## Environment & Background
- **Background**: Pure black, creating high contrast and focus on the illuminated objects
- **Surface**: Large, flat light gray plane serving as the primary work surface
- **Wireframe Structure**: Orange/amber-colored wireframe geometry outlining the scene boundaries and light projections, suggesting a defined render space or bounding box

## Lighting System
The scene employs two distinct light sources (as labeled):

1. **Directional Light** (labeled "Dir. Light"): Upper left position, creating broad illumination across the scene
2. **Spot Light** (labeled "Spot Light"): Upper center-right position, projecting a focused cone of light visible through the wireframe geometry

Both lights cast visible rays within the wireframe, demonstrating their directional properties and coverage areas.

## Objects
Two red geometric forms are positioned on the surface:

1. **Left/Center Object**: A red sphere with what appears to be a glowing or semi-transparent quality, serving as the primary focal point
2. **Right Object**: A red cube with sharp, defined edges, demonstrating material and reflection properties

## Technical Purpose
This setup is typical for **educational demonstrations** or **testing** of Three.js lighting systems, shadow rendering, and material interactions under controlled conditions.
