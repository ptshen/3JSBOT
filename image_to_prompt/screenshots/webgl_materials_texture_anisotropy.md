# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist architectural visualization featuring a perfectly symmetrical perspective view of an expansive wooden floor extending toward a distant vanishing point.

## Key Elements

### Floor
- **Material**: Richly textured wooden planks with warm brown and tan tones
- **Pattern**: Linear wood grain running perpendicular to the viewing direction, creating strong directional lines that guide the viewer's eye toward the horizon
- **Texture Detail**: High-resolution surface with subtle variations in wood color and natural grain patterns, suggesting aged hardwood
- **Perspective**: Classic one-point perspective with dramatic foreshortening, emphasizing depth and scale

### Architecture
- **Vertical Element**: A central dark vertical line/column dividing the composition directly down the middle, creating perfect bilateral symmetry
- **Walls/Ceiling**: Clean white or off-white surfaces above the floor, suggesting an enclosed interior space
- **Lighting**: Cool, even overhead lighting from above, creating subtle shadow lines across the wooden planks that enhance the perspective effect

### Aesthetic
- **Style**: Contemporary minimalist with strong geometric principles
- **Mood**: Clean, serene, and contemplative
- **Technical Quality**: Smooth shading and proper perspective rendering typical of a well-configured Three.js scene

This appears to be a demonstration of perspective rendering, texture mapping, and spatial depth representation in WebGL.
