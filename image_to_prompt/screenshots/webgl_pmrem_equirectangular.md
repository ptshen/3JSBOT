# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a meticulously arranged grid of 30 spheres (6 columns × 5 rows) displayed against a soft, gradient background transitioning from warm pink/rose tones on the left to cool blue tones on the right.

## Material & Lighting Characteristics

**Progressive Material Transformation:**
- **Left Column (Columns 1-2):** Highly reflective, metallic spheres with visible environment map reflections showing warm golden and bronze tones
- **Middle Columns (Columns 3-4):** Transitional spheres with decreasing reflectivity, displaying frosted or brushed metal appearance
- **Right Columns (Columns 5-6):** Matte, pearl-white spheres with minimal reflectivity and soft diffuse surfaces

## Lighting Setup
- **Key Light:** Positioned to create subtle specular highlights on the matte spheres
- **Environment Lighting:** A graduated HDR or similar environment map reflecting warm indoor/studio lighting on the metallic spheres
- **Global Illumination:** Soft ambient lighting preventing harsh shadows, creating a clean, professional product visualization aesthetic

## Visual Hierarchy
The composition demonstrates a **material property gradient** - effectively showcasing the progression from highly reflective metallic surfaces to completely diffuse matte finishes, making it ideal for material library documentation, shader demonstration, or product material selection visualization.

**Render Quality:** Clean anti-aliasing, no visible artifacts, professional polish consistent with high-end three.js implementations.
