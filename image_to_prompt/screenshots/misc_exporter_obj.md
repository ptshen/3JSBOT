# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist Three.js scene rendered against a pure black background, featuring a single geometric element as the focal point.

## Primary Object
**Green Triangle (Right-Angled Triangle)**
- **Color**: Bright lime green (#00FF00 or similar)
- **Shape**: A right-angled triangle with clean, sharp edges
- **Orientation**: Positioned in the upper-center portion of the viewport, with the right angle at the bottom-left corner
- **Size**: Moderate scale, occupying roughly 8-10% of the screen space
- **Position**: Slightly left of center, in the upper third of the frame

## Lighting & Material
- **Flat Shading**: The triangle appears to use a flat material without gradients or shading variations
- **No Shadows**: There are no visible shadows, indicating either no light source or unidirectional flat lighting
- **Specular Properties**: The triangle shows no reflection or specularity

## Camera & Perspective
- **View**: Orthographic or perspective view with the object facing the camera directly
- **Depth**: The triangle appears to exist at a shallow depth in the scene

## Atmosphere
The stark black background creates high contrast, emphasizing the vibrant green geometric form in an otherwise empty, void-like space. This minimalist approach is typical of demonstrations or UI element rendering in Three.js.
