# 3D Scene Description: Marble Rabbit Sculpture

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist 3D rendering featuring a pristine white marble or plaster sculpture of a rabbit positioned in the center of a neutral, graduated background.

## Lighting & Atmosphere
- **Primary Lighting**: A single directional light source positioned from the upper left, creating sharp, well-defined shadows
- **Shadow Quality**: Crisp, dark shadows cast directly beneath and to the right of the figure, indicating strong directional illumination
- **Ambient Lighting**: Subtle ambient fill light prevents pure blacks, maintaining detail visibility
- **Background**: Smooth gradient transitioning from lighter tones at the top to slightly warmer/darker tones toward the bottom, creating atmospheric depth

## The Rabbit Sculpture
- **Material**: Appears to be sculpted marble or high-quality plaster with a matte finish
- **Pose**: Dynamic upright stance with long ears pointed upward, front paws raised slightly
- **Style**: Realistic anatomical rendering with careful attention to musculature and form
- **Finish**: Smooth surface with subtle modeling details suggesting professional sculptural work
- **Color**: Pure white/off-white with very slight gray undertones in shadowed areas

## Technical Rendering
- **Anti-aliasing**: Clean, smooth edges with proper AA implementation
- **Surface Quality**: High polygon count with excellent surface smoothness
- **Perspective**: Slight low-angle view emphasizing the upright posture

This appears to be a product visualization or digital sculpture showcase, ideal for gallery presentation or 3D asset demonstration.
