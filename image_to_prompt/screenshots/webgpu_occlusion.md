# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist 3D scene rendered in Three.js featuring a single geometric object against a stark black background.

## Key Elements

**Primary Object:**
- A **blue cube** positioned in the upper-center portion of the viewport
- The cube displays a rich, saturated blue color (appears to be RGB blue or similar primary blue)
- Rendered with flat shading that emphasizes its cubic geometry
- The cube appears to have minimal or no visible lighting effects, suggesting either:
  - Basic ambient lighting
  - Unlit/emissive material properties
  - Direct color assignment without complex shading

**Lighting & Atmosphere:**
- Completely black background indicating no environment lighting or skybox
- The cube's uniform color suggests either:
  - Uniform ambient lighting from all directions
  - Simple flat rendering without complex light interactions
- No visible shadows or reflections

**Camera & Perspective:**
- Orthographic or slightly perspective view
- The cube is centered horizontally and positioned in the upper-middle area vertically
- No visible depth cues like perspective distortion or shadows

## Overall Impression
This is a clean, educational, or debug-style scene—likely used for demonstrating basic Three.js geometry creation, material properties, or as a simple starting template. The simplicity suggests it's a proof-of-concept rather than a complex visualization.
