# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist three.js scene featuring a single geometric object against a serene background.

## Background
- **Color**: Soft, muted blue-gray gradient
- **Atmosphere**: Clean and simple, providing an uncluttered environment that emphasizes the foreground object
- **Lighting**: Appears to be evenly lit with soft ambient illumination

## Primary Object
- **Shape**: A cube/box geometry
- **Color**: Bright, vibrant red with a pure, saturated hue (RGB close to 255, 0, 0)
- **Position**: Centered horizontally in the viewport, positioned in the upper-middle portion of the scene
- **Size**: Medium-scale, clearly visible and prominent
- **Rendering**: Standard three.js material with flat shading, showing minimal specular highlights
- **Perspective**: Appears to be rendered in an orthographic or weakly-perspective view, with the cube shown at a slight angle revealing two visible faces

## Lighting & Shadows
- Minimal shadow presence, suggesting either orthographic rendering or very distant point lights
- Clean, shadow-free appearance indicates either ambient lighting or absence of dynamic shadows

## Overall Aesthetic
A clean, educational rendering typical of three.js documentation or basic 3D graphics tutorials—demonstrating fundamental geometry rendering without complex materials, textures, or environmental effects.
