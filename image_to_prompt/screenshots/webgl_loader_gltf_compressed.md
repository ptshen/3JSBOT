# 3D Scene Description: Robotic Cookie Dunking Station

## Overview
This is a charming and whimsical three.js rendered scene depicting an automated robotic system designed to dunk cookies into a cup of milk or beverage.

## Key Components

### Robotic Arm
- **Color**: Sage green/mint finish
- **Design**: Multi-jointed articulated arm with smooth, rounded segments
- **Function**: Positioned to hold and manipulate a cookie for dunking
- **Details**: The arm features bendable joints that allow for precise positioning and movement control

### Cookie Elements
- **Two Oreo-style cookies** rendered with dark brown/black exteriors and cream-colored centers
- **Placement**: 
  - One cookie is held by the robotic gripper at the end of the arm
  - Another cookie rests on or near the container base
- **Detail Level**: High-fidelity texture showing the characteristic ridged pattern of sandwich cookies

### Container/Cup
- **Design**: A cream-colored cylindrical mug or cup with horizontal sage green bands/stripes
- **Purpose**: Serves as the "dunk target" filled with liquid
- **Aesthetic**: Retro, minimalist design complementing the mechanical arm

## Rendering Details
- **Background**: Neutral gray surface with subtle perspective grid
- **Lighting**: Soft, even illumination creating subtle shadows and depth
- **Style**: Clean, product-visualization aesthetic typical of three.js demonstrations
- **Overall Tone**: Playful, industrial design meets everyday whimsy

This scene exemplifies creative 3D modeling by combining mechanical precision with humorous domesticity.
