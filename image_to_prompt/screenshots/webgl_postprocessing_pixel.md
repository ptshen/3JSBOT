# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a low-polygon, voxel-style 3D scene rendered in three.js, featuring a blocky, Minecraft-inspired aesthetic with a stylized, isometric perspective.

## Environmental Elements

**Ground/Floor:**
- A checkered plane composed of alternating gray and tan/beige square tiles
- Creates a classic grid pattern typical of game engines and 3D modeling software
- Provides depth perception and spatial reference

## Central Objects

**Main Structure (Left):**
- A dark gray/charcoal colored cubic structure with a stepped or pyramidal silhouette
- Appears to be a multi-layered voxel construction with blocky geometry
- The layered design suggests it could represent terrain, a building, or decorative structure
- Casts subtle shadows indicating directional lighting

**Floating Element (Top Right):**
- A bright cyan/turquoise colored sphere
- Positioned above and to the right of the main structure
- Appears to be a glowing orb or particle effect
- Contrasts sharply against the muted earth tones of the rest of the scene

## Lighting & Atmosphere
- Neutral dark blue-black background
- Warm directional lighting that emphasizes the blocky geometry
- Subtle shadowing beneath objects creates depth
- The cyan sphere emits or reflects light, making it the focal point

This style is commonly used in game development, voxel-based games, or stylized 3D applications.
