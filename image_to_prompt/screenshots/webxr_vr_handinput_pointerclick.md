# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist 3D scene rendered in Three.js against a neutral dark gray background (#4a4a4a). The composition features a central 3D object with UI elements positioned in the lower right quadrant.

## Main 3D Object
**Geometry:** A white/light gray toroidal knot or interlocking torus shape - a mathematically sophisticated geometric form consisting of smooth, continuous curved surfaces that loop and interweave with themselves.

**Material Properties:**
- Matte white or light gray surface finish
- Soft, diffuse shading suggesting a Lambert or standard material
- Subtle shadow gradation on the underside of curves, indicating realistic lighting

**Lighting:**
- Soft key light from the upper left, creating gentle highlights on the upper curves
- Secondary fill light providing definition without harsh shadows
- The lighting creates dimensional depth while maintaining the object's elegant simplicity

## UI Elements
Located in the bottom right corner:

1. **Tan/Beige Rectangle** - A neutral-toned rectangular button or display element
2. **Red Rectangle** - A secondary control element
3. **Text Labels:**
   - "reset" (in blue/cyan text) - likely associated with the tan element
   - "exit" (in white text on red) - associated with the red button

## Technical Execution
The scene demonstrates professional Three.js rendering with clean anti-aliasing, proper perspective, and effective use of negative space to emphasize the central geometric form.
