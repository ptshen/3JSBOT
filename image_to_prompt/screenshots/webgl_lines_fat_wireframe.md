# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a clean, minimalist 3D visualization rendered in Three.js against a pure black background. The scene features geometric wireframe structures with striking blue coloring.

## Primary Element
**Large Central Icosphere**: The dominant feature is a substantial wireframe sphere constructed from triangular faces, positioned in the center-right of the viewport. The structure exhibits the characteristic geodesic subdivision pattern of an icosphere, with interconnected vertices forming a complex lattice of triangles. The wireframe uses bright cyan/electric blue lines that create excellent contrast against the black background.

## Secondary Element
**Small Reference Sphere**: In the lower left corner sits a significantly smaller, solid-rendered sphere also in the same vibrant blue color. This appears to function as a scale reference or UI element, helping viewers understand the relative size of the main geometry. This sphere has a smoother, textured appearance with subtle surface detail/shading.

## Technical Characteristics
- **Rendering Style**: Clean wireframe with blue lines (likely using `THREE.LineSegments` or similar)
- **Lighting**: Minimal ambient lighting; the blue color is achieved through material properties rather than dynamic illumination
- **Camera Perspective**: Slightly angled isometric-like view of the central sphere, providing good visibility of the 3D structure

## Aesthetic
The scene has a technical, scientific quality typical of data visualization, physics simulation visualization, or educational 3D content.
