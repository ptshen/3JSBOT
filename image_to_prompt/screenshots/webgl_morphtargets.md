# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist three.js scene featuring a single geometric object against a serene gradient background.

## Background
- **Color**: Soft, muted blue gradient that transitions subtly across the canvas
- **Atmosphere**: Creates a calm, uncluttered environment with excellent contrast for the foreground element

## Primary Object
- **Type**: A cube (rectangular prism)
- **Color**: Vibrant red (#FF0000 or similar)
- **Position**: Centered horizontally and positioned in the upper-middle portion of the viewport
- **Dimensions**: Medium-sized, appearing to have equal width and height (cube geometry)
- **Lighting**: The cube receives even, clean lighting that emphasizes its geometric form with subtle shading on visible faces, suggesting a standard three.js directional or ambient light setup

## Rendering Quality
- **Shading**: Flat, clean surfaces with minimal complexity
- **Shadows**: Minimal to no visible shadows, indicating either a shadow-free setup or very subtle shadow mapping
- **Anti-aliasing**: Clean edges on the cube, suggesting proper rendering pipeline

## Overall Aesthetic
This appears to be a fundamental three.js demonstration or tutorial scene - a classic "Hello World" equivalent for 3D web graphics, showcasing basic cube rendering, lighting, and camera setup.
