# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a split-screen comparison showcasing two renderings of an infinite wooden floor plane, likely demonstrating different rendering techniques, lighting conditions, or shader implementations in three.js.

## Left Panel
- **Surface**: A weathered wooden floor with medium-to-dark brown tones
- **Perspective**: Extreme linear perspective converging toward the horizon
- **Texture Details**: Wood grain patterns run diagonally across the plane, creating a sense of depth
- **Lighting**: Soft, diffuse ambient lighting with subtle directional shadows cast by the planks
- **Atmosphere**: Relatively neutral, with even illumination across the surface

## Right Panel
- **Surface**: Identical wooden floor material with similar grain patterns
- **Perspective**: Matching linear perspective convergence
- **Texture Details**: More pronounced surface detail and shadow definition
- **Lighting**: Appears to have a stronger directional light source, creating more dramatic shadows along the wood grain lines
- **Atmosphere**: Enhanced contrast with deeper shadow definition, suggesting optimized or alternative lighting/shadow rendering

## Technical Observations
- Both scenes likely use a **plane geometry** with high subdivisions to showcase perspective
- **Material**: Probably a standard or Phong material with a wood texture map
- **Camera**: Positioned very close to the plane with a wide field of view
- **Rendering Purpose**: Likely a comparison of shadow mapping, normal mapping, or lighting algorithms

This appears to be a quality or feature comparison test for three.js rendering capabilities.
