# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist 3D rendering featuring a single geometric object centered in the frame against a clean, neutral background.

## Lighting & Environment
- **Background**: Soft white/light gray gradient surface, suggesting a simple studio lighting setup
- **Lighting**: Professional three-point lighting with warm and cool tones creating dimensional modeling
- **Shadow**: Subtle shadow cast to the lower right, indicating directional key light from the upper left

## Main Object: Gradient Cube
The central element is a **unit cube** with a vibrant, multi-color gradient mapping:

**Color Distribution:**
- **Top face**: Cyan/turquoise blue transitioning to yellow-green
- **Left face**: Deep purple/magenta at the bottom, fading to blue at the top
- **Right face**: Warm magenta/pink tones with purple undertones
- **Overall effect**: A smooth, vertex-based color gradient (likely using THREE.Color with per-vertex coloring)

## Technical Observations
- Clean, flat shader rendering (no complex materials or reflections)
- Sharp geometric edges with anti-aliasing
- Orthographic or slightly perspective camera framing
- High-quality output suggesting WebGL rendering with proper color space management

This appears to be a **classic three.js demonstration**, showcasing basic mesh geometry, gradient materials, and fundamental lighting principles.
