# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a three.js visualization displaying a biomechanical or anatomical model with heat map coloring. The scene features a clean, minimalist presentation against a light gray background.

## Main Elements

### Color Legend (Left)
A vertical gradient bar serves as a heat map scale, transitioning smoothly through the spectrum:
- **Red** at the top (indicating highest values/heat)
- **Orange and Yellow** in the upper-middle range
- **Green** in the center
- **Cyan** in the lower-middle range
- **Blue** at the bottom (indicating lowest values/coolest regions)

### 3D Model (Center-Right)
An elongated, curved anatomical structure—likely representing a bone, segment, or biological component—is rendered with sophisticated heat map texturing. The model exhibits:
- **Blue coloration** on the upper/outer curved section (cool zones)
- **Yellow-green transitions** along the middle regions
- **Orange-yellow gradients** on the lower tapered end (warm zones)
- A smooth, organic curve suggesting a natural anatomical form

## Technical Aspects
- **Lighting**: Subtle directional lighting reveals surface topology and curvature
- **Rendering**: Smooth shading with proper material properties
- **Color Mapping**: Appears to represent stress distribution, temperature, or intensity analysis
- **Perspective**: Slight 3D rotation angle providing good visual clarity

This visualization style is typical of engineering analysis, biomechanical simulation, or medical imaging output.
