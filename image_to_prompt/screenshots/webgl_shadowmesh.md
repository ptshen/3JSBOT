# Three.js Scene Description

## Environment & Atmosphere
- **Sky**: A vibrant, clear blue gradient background occupying the upper two-thirds of the viewport
- **Lighting**: Bright, natural daylight with no visible clouds
- **Weather Element**: A small yellow lightning bolt in the upper right corner, suggesting an approaching storm or electrical phenomenon

## Landscape
- **Terrain**: A curved, rolling green hillscape that dominates the lower portion of the scene
- **Perspective**: The horizon line curves gently, creating a sense of standing on a spherical or very large rounded landscape
- **Ground Material**: Solid green surface with subtle shading to convey depth and curvature

## Objects in the Scene

**Left Side:**
- A golden/yellow cone or triangular prism-shaped object positioned on the green terrain

**Center Area:**
- A dark red/maroon cube floating above the ground
- A red circle or wireframe ring positioned to the right and slightly above the cube

**Right Side:**
- A reflective metallic sphere (chrome/silver finish) with visible specular highlights, casting subtle shadows on the ground

**Shadow Element:**
- A dark horizontal line or shadow beneath the central floating cube

## Overall Aesthetic
The scene has a minimalist, almost surrealist quality with geometric primitives arranged in a dreamlike composition, rendered with clean materials and realistic lighting.
