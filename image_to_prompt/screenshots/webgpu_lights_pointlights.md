# Three.js 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a striking three-dimensional portrait bust rendered with sophisticated lighting and material techniques. The scene features a human head model positioned centrally against a pure black background, creating dramatic contrast and focus.

## Geometric Elements
- **Primary Subject**: A smooth, stylized head sculpture rendered with clean topology
- **Base**: A subtle cylindrical or pedestal base supporting the bust
- **Form**: The head displays anatomically simplified features with smooth surfaces, suggesting a modern, abstract aesthetic rather than photorealism

## Lighting & Materials
- **Dual-Color Lighting Scheme**: 
  - Warm red/magenta light source illuminating the right side of the face
  - Cool cyan/blue light source illuminating the left side
  - Creates a vibrant split-lighting effect (often called "neon" or "cyberpunk" style)

- **Material Properties**:
  - Highly reflective, glossy surface finish
  - Metallic or polished appearance
  - Strong specular highlights catching the light sources
  - Appears to be a single-material object with consistent surface properties

## Technical Aspects
- **Rendering Quality**: High-quality mesh with good edge definition
- **Lighting Setup**: Two-point or multi-light setup creating dimensional separation
- **Atmosphere**: Cinematic presentation suitable for portfolio work or digital art exhibition

The overall effect is modern, stylish, and evocative of contemporary digital sculpture and visualization techniques.
