# 3D Scene Description: Lighthouse Material Comparison

## Overall Composition
This is a sophisticated side-by-side material comparison visualization featuring a central orange and white rocket/spacecraft model flanked by two spherical material sample objects. The scene demonstrates the differences between two lighthouse material types through interactive 3D rendering.

## Central Model
- **Rocket/Spacecraft**: An orange and white vertical rocket or spacecraft positioned centrally, serving as the focal point and scale reference
- Clean, minimalist design with contrasting color scheme
- Positioned on a flat gray ground plane

## Left Sphere: Lighthouse Standard Material
- **Material Type**: Large, dark-gray metallic sphere on the left
- **Properties Displayed**:
  - Luminosity
  - Diffuse (multiple blue gradient dots showing variation)
  - Specular highlights
  - Shininess
  - Reflection characteristics
  - Bump Height
  - Refraction properties
  - Textured Example (showing material application)

## Right Sphere: Lighthouse Principled BSDF
- **Material Type**: Lighter, more reflective cyan/turquoise sphere on the right
- **Properties Displayed**:
  - Deep & Metallic variations
  - Metalness parameters
  - Luminous Color
  - Clearcoat & Clearcoat Gloss
  - Metallic qualities
  - Transparency settings
  - Bump Height
  - Refraction
  - Textured Example (showing practical application)

## Lighting & Environment
- **Illumination**: Soft, professional three-point lighting setup
- **Ground Plane**: Gray surface providing contrast and context
- **Shadows**: Subtle shadowing beneath objects for depth perception
- **Ambient**: Neutral gray background preventing distraction

## Interactive Elements
The UI appears designed to allow users to adjust material properties in real-time, with visual feedback through the sphere materials and the rocket model showcasing how different material parameters affect final appearance.
