# Scene Description

This three.js scene features a minimalist composition with the following elements:

## Main Objects
- **Large Dark Rectangle/Plane**: A prominent dark gray or charcoal-colored rectangular form positioned in the upper-center portion of the scene, appearing to be a flat plane or box viewed at an angle.

## Particle System/Effects
- **Scattered Yellow-Gold Particles**: A loose, organic scatter of small yellow or golden-yellow points clustered near the lower-left edge of the dark rectangle. These particles appear to be:
  - Emitted or dispersed from the rectangle's lower-left corner
  - Following a downward trajectory
  - Creating a sense of motion or dissolution
  - Rendered with a glowing or luminous quality against the black background

## Lighting & Atmosphere
- **High Contrast**: Strong contrast between the dark elements and the black background creates visual depth
- **Ambient Darkness**: A pure black background with no visible environmental lighting, suggesting an isolated studio-like setting
- **Particle Glow**: The yellow particles have a slight luminosity, suggesting point lights or emissive materials

## Overall Mood
The scene conveys a sense of **decay, dispersion, or energy release**, with the particle effect suggesting something is breaking apart or emanating from the solid geometric form. The minimalist composition emphasizes the dramatic contrast and movement of the scattered elements.
