# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a low-polygon, voxel-style 3D scene rendered in three.js with an isometric or slightly angled perspective view. The aesthetic evokes retro computer graphics or Minecraft-inspired visuals.

## Environment
- **Ground Plane**: A checkerboard pattern of alternating gray and darker gray tiles that extends across the base of the scene, creating depth and perspective
- **Lighting**: Subtle ambient lighting with gentle shadowing that gives the voxelated objects dimension and form
- **Background**: Solid dark navy/black void that makes the scene elements stand out

## Objects

### Left Structure
- A dark gray/charcoal colored **cubic compound object** with an irregular, blocky silhouette
- Appears to be a **stepped or tiered structure**, possibly resembling a stylized building, fortress, or abstract sculpture
- Contains multiple rectangular protrusions and recesses creating visual complexity

### Right Object
- A **bright cyan/turquoise blue sphere** positioned prominently on the right side
- Sits atop or adjacent to the main structure
- The vibrant color contrasts sharply against the muted grays and blacks, drawing immediate visual focus

## Technical Qualities
- **Pixelated/voxelated aesthetic** with clearly defined block geometry
- Soft shadow casting creates realistic depth
- Minimalist color palette dominated by grays, blacks, and the accent cyan
- Orthographic-style perspective emphasizing the geometric forms

The scene has a puzzle-like or game-asset quality, suggesting it might be prototype visualization or stylized 3D modeling work.
