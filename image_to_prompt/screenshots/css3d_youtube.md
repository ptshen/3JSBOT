# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a sophisticated 3D product visualization of a **black cubic box/package** rendered with professional lighting and materials. The box is displayed in an isometric perspective, allowing simultaneous visibility of three faces, creating a dynamic and engaging product presentation.

## Visual Elements

### Box Design
- **Material**: Matte black with selective glossy accents
- **Structure**: Clean cubic geometry with sharp edges
- **Texture**: High-resolution printed graphics on each visible face
- **Dimensions**: Appears to be a standard product box (likely retail packaging)

### Graphics and Imagery
- **Front Face**: Features a thermal/heat map visualization with vibrant orange, red, and blue gradient colors, suggesting scientific or technical imagery (possibly thermal imaging or data visualization)
- **Top Face**: Contains black and white photography or technical diagrams
- **Right Face**: Shows black and white imagery with text/label information
- All faces appear to have high-quality printing with visible typography and branding

### Lighting Setup
- **Key Light**: Soft, warm-toned lighting from the upper left
- **Fill Light**: Ambient lighting providing subtle shadows on the right side
- **Highlights**: Subtle specular highlights on edges indicating a semi-gloss finish
- **Shadows**: Soft drop shadow beneath the box for depth and grounding

### Technical Execution
- Professional antialiasing with smooth edges
- Realistic material properties with appropriate specularity
- Proper depth perception and perspective
- Clean, studio-quality presentation typical of e-commerce or marketing visualization
