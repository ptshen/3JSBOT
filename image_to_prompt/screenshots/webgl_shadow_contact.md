# 3D Scene Description

This is a vibrant, modern 3D composition featuring abstract geometric shapes rendered in three.js with a clean, contemporary aesthetic.

## Key Elements:

**Color Palette:**
- Dominant neon colors: magenta/pink, cyan/turquoise, and electric blue
- Purple accents
- Lime green highlights
- White background for high contrast

**Geometric Objects:**

1. **Left Side - Polyhedral Shape**
   - Irregular, faceted geometric form
   - Multiple triangular and polygonal faces
   - Gradient coloring with magenta, purple, and cyan faces
   - Creates a 3D crystal-like or fragmented appearance

2. **Center - Curved Connector**
   - A smooth, curved pipe or tube element
   - Gradient transitioning from magenta through purple to cyan
   - Acts as a visual link between the shapes
   - Features a loop/hook-like structure at the top

3. **Right Side - Cube**
   - Solid cube with a bright purple/blue color
   - Sharp, clean geometry contrasting with the irregular left shape
   - Lime green highlighted edge or accent

**Lighting & Shadows:**
- Soft shadows beneath objects suggesting depth
- Smooth ambient lighting
- Subtle gradient shading on curved elements
- Glossy material reflections

**Overall Composition:**
The arrangement suggests a playful, modern design system—possibly representing connectivity, data flow, or modular components. The balance between organic curves and geometric solids creates visual interest and dynamism.
