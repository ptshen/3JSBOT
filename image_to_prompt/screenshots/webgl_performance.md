# 3D Scene Description

## Overview
This is an isometric aerial view of a **fortified medieval settlement or castle complex** rendered in Three.js with realistic lighting and textures against a pure black background.

## Architectural Elements

### Main Structures
- **Central Keep/Tower**: A prominent rectangular structure with detailed stonework, appearing to be the primary defensive position
- **Defensive Walls**: Thick perimeter fortifications with crenellations (notched parapets) typical of medieval military architecture
- **Multiple Buildings**: Various interconnected structures suggesting a self-contained garrison or residential complex

### Detail Features
- Textured stone facades showing age and weathering
- Detailed roofing with visible shingles or tiles
- Doorways, windows, and architectural openings
- Corner towers and defensive positions at strategic points

## Lighting & Rendering
- **Single directional light source** creating dramatic shadows and depth
- **Warm, golden-hour lighting** from an upper-left angle
- High-quality **ambient occlusion** enhancing crevices and architectural details
- **Realistic texture mapping** showing stone, aged materials, and surface imperfections

## Artistic Quality
- Professional **isometric camera angle** providing clear spatial understanding
- Excellent **depth perception** through shadow work
- Clean, polished rendering typical of architectural visualization
- Strong contrast between illuminated and shadowed areas

This appears to be a historically-inspired 3D model, possibly for a game, historical simulation, or architectural study.
