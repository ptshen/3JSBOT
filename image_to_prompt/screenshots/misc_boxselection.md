# 3D Scene Description: Abstract Geometric Particle Explosion

## Overview
This is a dynamic three.js scene featuring an explosive burst of colorful 3D cubes and rectangular prisms scattered across a white background, creating a sense of energetic dispersal from a central point.

## Key Visual Elements

### Geometry & Structure
- **Primary Objects**: Numerous small cubes and rectangular blocks of varying sizes
- **Distribution**: Objects radiate outward from an invisible center point, suggesting a particle explosion or burst effect
- **Scale Variation**: Cubes range from very small to medium-sized, creating visual depth and hierarchy

### Color Palette
The scene employs a vibrant, diverse color scheme including:
- **Bright Neon Colors**: Lime green, electric pink/magenta, cyan blue
- **Primary Colors**: Pure red, blue, yellow
- **Dark Tones**: Deep purple, black, dark green, maroon
- **Warm Tones**: Orange, brown, olive green
- **Cool Tones**: Various shades of blue and purple

The colors appear somewhat randomly distributed, creating visual chaos and energy.

### Lighting & Rendering
- **Illumination**: Clean, uniform white background with subtle shadows on each cube
- **Material**: Cubes appear to have a matte or slightly glossy finish with realistic shadowing
- **Perspective**: Isometric or slightly angled orthographic view

### Composition
The arrangement follows a classic particle system pattern with density concentrated near the center, gradually dispersing toward the edges, suggesting motion and temporal progression.
