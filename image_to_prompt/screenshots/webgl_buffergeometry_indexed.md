# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist 3D scene featuring a single geometric plane positioned against a pure black background, creating a striking contrast that emphasizes the visual element.

## Primary Object
**Gradient Plane/Quad:**
- A square or rectangular flat plane occupies the center of the viewport
- The plane displays a smooth, multi-color gradient that transitions seamlessly across its surface

## Color Gradient Details
The gradient exhibits a sophisticated color progression:
- **Top-left corner**: Deep royal blue
- **Top-right corner**: Vibrant magenta/hot pink
- **Bottom-left corner**: Bright cyan/turquoise
- **Bottom-right corner**: Near-white or very light pink
- The gradient flows diagonally from cool tones (blue/cyan) to warm tones (magenta/pink), with a luminous transition toward the bottom-right

## Lighting & Rendering
- Clean, neutral lighting with no visible shadows or depth complexity
- The gradient appears to be a texture or material applied to the plane rather than lighting-based shading
- Smooth interpolation suggests bilinear or advanced gradient filtering

## Camera & Perspective
- Orthographic or near-orthographic view
- The plane faces directly toward the camera with no visible rotation or 3D perspective distortion
- Centered composition with balanced negative space

## Aesthetic
This appears to be a **material showcase** or **color study demonstration**, commonly used in three.js projects to display texture capabilities or design gradients.
