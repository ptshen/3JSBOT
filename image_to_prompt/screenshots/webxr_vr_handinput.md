# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist 3D scene rendered in three.js featuring a single geometric object against a neutral background.

## Key Elements

**Background:**
- Solid dark gray (#4a4a4a or similar) environment, providing subtle contrast without distraction
- Flat, featureless backdrop suggesting either a void or distant fog

**Primary Object:**
- A **truncated pyramid or trapezoid prism** positioned in the lower-center portion of the viewport
- The shape appears to be a rectangular box with the top face smaller than the bottom face, creating a trapezoidal profile when viewed from the front
- **Color:** Medium gray (#888888 or similar), with subtle shading that indicates basic lighting

## Lighting & Shading
- **Ambient lighting** creates even illumination across the surface with minimal shadows
- Subtle edge highlights suggest a soft, directional light source positioned above and slightly forward
- The flat shading gives the object a clean, geometric appearance without texture mapping

## Perspective & Camera
- **Front-facing orthogonal or near-orthogonal view** with slight downward angle
- The object appears deliberately centered and symmetrical
- Camera distance suggests an intimate but detached observation point

## Overall Aesthetic
Minimalist and clinical—typical of architectural visualization, UI demonstrations, or technical 3D previews. The scene prioritizes clarity and geometric form over realism or environmental storytelling.
