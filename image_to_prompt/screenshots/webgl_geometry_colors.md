# Three.js Scene Description

## Overview
This is a beautifully rendered 3D scene featuring three geodesic spheres positioned horizontally across the frame, each displaying distinct color gradients and lighting characteristics.

## Individual Objects

### Left Sphere - Rainbow Gradient
- **Colors**: Vibrant transition from cyan/turquoise (bottom-left) through lime green and yellow to orange and red (top-center)
- **Material**: Appears to have a matte or standard material with good diffuse reflection
- **Lighting**: Well-lit with warm ambient lighting on the upper hemisphere

### Center Sphere - Warm Orange-Red Gradient
- **Colors**: Rich gradient from deep orange at the top transitioning to darker amber and brown tones at the base
- **Material**: Similar matte finish to the left sphere
- **Lighting**: Consistent warm illumination across the surface with slightly darker shadowing at the bottom

### Right Sphere - Desaturated Red-Brown
- **Colors**: Muted burgundy and dark red tones transitioning to brown and charcoal gray
- **Material**: Appears slightly more subdued in saturation
- **Lighting**: Cooler lighting compared to the other spheres, with pronounced shadows creating depth

## Technical Details
- **Geometry**: Each sphere uses an icosahedron or similar low-poly geodesic structure with visible triangular facets
- **Shading**: Flat-shaded triangular faces with edge lines visible, creating a faceted gem-like appearance
- **Lighting Setup**: Appears to use directional or multi-directional lighting with subtle shadows cast below each sphere
- **Background**: Clean white or light gray background
- **Shadows**: Subtle drop shadows beneath each sphere for depth perception

This composition effectively demonstrates color mapping, gradient transitions, and lighting techniques in three.js.
