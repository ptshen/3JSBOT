# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a stunning particle explosion or burst effect rendered in three.js, featuring hundreds of colorful geometric fragments dispersing outward from a central focal point. The particles are captured mid-explosion, creating a dynamic sense of motion and energy.

## Visual Elements

**Particles & Geometry:**
- Small cubic/rectangular fragments of varying sizes scatter across the frame
- Each particle maintains individual 3D dimensionality with visible depth and perspective
- The fragments appear to be expanding radially outward with velocity, suggesting a physical explosion or disintegration effect

**Color Palette:**
- Vibrant gradient transitioning from purple and magenta in the upper left
- Electric blue dominates the center and upper regions
- Cyan and turquoise tones appear throughout
- Mint green accents on the right and lower right edges
- Hot pink/magenta highlights create visual pop and interest

**Lighting & Shading:**
- Each particle is individually lit with glossy/metallic material properties
- Gradient shading across particle surfaces creates depth perception
- Specular highlights suggest a light source positioned above-left
- The lighting enhances the 3D dimensionality of the geometry

**Composition:**
- White background provides clean contrast to the vibrant particles
- Particles decrease in density toward the edges, creating natural visual falloff
- The perspective suggests viewing from the center of an expanding sphere

This is a classic three.js particle system demonstration showcasing effective use of geometry, materials, physics simulation, and color theory.
