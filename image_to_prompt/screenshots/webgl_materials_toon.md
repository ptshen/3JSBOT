# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist, symmetrical 3D visualization featuring a grid of spheres arranged in a rectangular formation against a serene deep purple background. The scene demonstrates classic three.js rendering with clean lighting and material properties.

## Geometric Structure
- **Sphere Grid**: Approximately 6 columns × 8 rows of uniformly-sized spheres
- **Layout**: The spheres are precisely positioned in a grid pattern, creating a perfectly aligned rectangular array
- **Spacing**: Consistent, evenly-distributed gaps between each sphere

## Color Palette
The spheres feature a gradient of pastel colors transitioning across the formation:
- **Left side**: Warm coral/salmon pink tones
- **Left-center**: Peach and light tan hues
- **Center-left**: Pale yellow-green
- **Center**: Soft sage and muted green
- **Center-right**: Gentle lavender and mauve purples
- **Right side**: Muted dusty rose and muted coral pink tones

## Lighting & Materials
- **Material**: Matte or slightly glossy spheres with subtle shading
- **Lighting**: Soft, even illumination with gentle shadows creating depth and dimension
- **Background**: Smooth gradient purple backdrop (approximately RGB: 70, 60, 130)

## Text Elements
- Labels reading "gradient" and "gradientMap" appear on either side, suggesting this demonstrates gradient mapping functionality in three.js

## Visual Style
Clean, contemporary, and educational in nature—typical of technical documentation or shader/material demonstration visualizations.
