# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist, geometric architectural visualization rendered in Three.js, featuring a clean, isometric perspective of an interior space with a distinctly modern, grid-based aesthetic.

## Key Elements

### Lighting & Atmosphere
- **Sky**: Clear, light cyan/blue gradient dominating the upper portion
- **Overall Tone**: Cool color palette with blues and teals creating a serene, technical atmosphere
- **Lighting**: Soft, diffuse illumination suggesting overcast or studio lighting with subtle shadows defining depth

### Architecture & Geometry
- **Primary Surfaces**: 
  - Horizontal platform/floor with a subtle grid texture in light blue-gray
  - Vertical walls rendered in darker teal with a fine grid pattern overlay
  - The gridded surfaces create a technical, wireframe-like aesthetic

### Spatial Elements
- **Stairs/Steps**: A series of descending geometric forms creating a tiered, stepped platform
- **Perspective**: The composition uses linear perspective with strong vanishing points, emphasizing depth
- **Railings/Barriers**: Horizontal linear elements that appear to guide the viewer's eye through the space

### Aesthetic Characteristics
- **Minimalist Design**: Reduced color palette and clean geometry
- **Technical Feel**: Grid overlays and geometric precision suggest CAD/architectural visualization
- **Low-Poly Style**: Faceted surfaces with distinct polygonal construction visible
- **Isometric/Orthographic View**: Flattened perspective typical of architectural or technical renderings

This scene exemplifies modern 3D web graphics with an emphasis on clarity, geometry, and digital aesthetics.
