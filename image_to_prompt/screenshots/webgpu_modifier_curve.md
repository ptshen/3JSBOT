# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist three.js scene featuring a **3D text object suspended in space** against a pure black background, creating a stark, modern aesthetic.

## Key Elements

### Text Object
- **Content**: "iskeenq2023" displayed in a three-dimensional extruded font
- **Material**: Orange/amber colored with a metallic or glossy appearance
- **Style**: The text has notable depth, suggesting it's rendered with extrusion geometry
- **Positioning**: Centered in the viewport, floating in the middle of the scene

### Wireframe Structure
- **Green curved line**: A smooth, elliptical or orbital path rendered in green connecting four white spheres/points
- **Anchor points**: Four white spheres positioned at cardinal points around the text
  - Top-left, top-right, bottom-left positions clearly visible
  - These points define the boundary of an invisible geometric space
- **Purpose**: The wireframe creates a bounding volume or compositional framing device

## Lighting & Materials
- **Ambient lighting**: Sufficient to clearly render the text and wireframe
- **Text finish**: Appears to have specular highlights suggesting a slightly reflective surface
- **Wireframe rendering**: Clean, anti-aliased green lines with white vertex indicators

## Overall Mood
Professional, technical, and contemporary—typical of portfolio pieces, branding explorations, or interactive web experiences.
