# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
A minimalist 3D scene featuring a single isometric cube positioned in the center-upper portion of the frame against a pure black background. The lighting and rendering suggest a clean, modern aesthetic typical of contemporary web-based 3D visualization.

## The Cube
**Geometry:** A perfect cube rendered in isometric perspective, allowing three faces to be simultaneously visible.

**Materials & Colors:**
- **Top face:** A vibrant cyan/turquoise color with a subtle gradient or highlight, suggesting a light source from above-left
- **Left face:** A deep blue/indigo, appearing in shadow relative to the top surface
- **Right face:** A vivid magenta/hot pink, creating a striking color contrast

The color palette appears to use a neon or vibrant material setting, possibly with slight emissive properties given the saturation and glow quality.

## Lighting
The lighting setup appears to be:
- A primary light source positioned above and to the left, illuminating the cyan top face most brightly
- Secondary ambient or fill lighting preventing complete darkness on the shadowed faces
- No visible shadows cast by the object, suggesting the black background extends infinitely or very far

## Technical Aspects
- **Camera angle:** Isometric or near-isometric perspective (~35° angles)
- **Rendering quality:** Clean, smooth geometry with anti-aliasing
- **Background:** Pure black (#000000), providing maximum contrast
- **Scale:** The cube appears medium-sized relative to the viewport

This is a quintessential example of modern 3D web graphics—clean, bold, and visually striking.
