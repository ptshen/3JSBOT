# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a vibrant, dynamically lit 3D scene featuring multiple rotated rectangular planes or cubes arranged in a scattered, three-dimensional composition against a pure black background. The arrangement creates a sense of depth and movement across the viewport.

## Visual Elements

**Geometric Forms:**
- Multiple rectangular planes/quads positioned at various angles and depths
- Sizes range from larger prominent pieces in the foreground to smaller fragments scattered throughout the background
- The planes appear to be tilted and rotated on multiple axes, creating an energetic, chaotic aesthetic

**Color & Lighting:**
- Each surface displays a vibrant **neon gradient** transitioning through the full spectrum: cyan, magenta, yellow, green, orange, and red
- The gradients appear to be linear, with colors flowing diagonally across each plane
- High saturation and brightness create an intense, eye-catching effect reminiscent of synthwave or cyberpunk aesthetics
- Subtle dithering/noise texture visible on surfaces, suggesting screen-space effects or shader-based patterns

**Lighting & Atmosphere:**
- Strong contrast between the glowing colored planes and the absolute black background
- No visible ambient lighting; planes appear self-luminous or heavily overexposed
- Creates a floating, isolated quality to each geometric element

## Technical Characteristics
- Clean, modern WebGL rendering with smooth gradients
- Possible use of `THREE.PlaneGeometry` or `THREE.BoxGeometry`
- Custom shaders likely driving the gradient and color effects
- Particle-like scattering suggests dynamic positioning, possibly via physics or animation

This scene exemplifies creative generative art or interactive visualization in three.js.
