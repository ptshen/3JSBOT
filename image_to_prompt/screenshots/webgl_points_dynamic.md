# 3D Scene Analysis: Thermal Data Visualization

## Overall Composition
This is a striking three.js scene depicting a group of human figures rendered in thermal imaging style against a dark environment. The visualization uses a heat-map color palette to represent data, creating a scientific or surveillance-like aesthetic.

## Visual Elements

### Figures
- **Quantity**: Approximately 8-10 humanoid forms arranged in a loose group formation
- **Rendering Style**: Low-poly geometric construction with voxelated or faceted surfaces
- **Thermal Color Mapping**: 
  - Bright yellow and orange representing high intensity/heat
  - Magenta and pink for mid-level values
  - Gray and darker tones for cooler regions
  - Creates a realistic thermal camera effect

### Environment
- **Background**: Pure black, providing maximum contrast
- **Ground Plane**: A receding grid of red and dark pixels extending into the distance, suggesting a digital landscape or heat-mapped floor
- **Perspective**: Grid converges toward the horizon, creating strong depth and vanishing point

### Lighting & Atmosphere
- **Glow Effect**: Each figure emits a subtle luminescent glow matching its thermal color
- **Color Intensity**: Vibrant neon-like quality suggesting data visualization or scientific monitoring
- **Shadows**: Faint geometric shadows cast backward on the grid

## Artistic Style
This scene evokes cyberpunk, data visualization, or futuristic surveillance aesthetics—blending scientific accuracy with artistic digital rendering.
