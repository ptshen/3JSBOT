# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist 3D scene rendered against a pure black background, featuring three distinct geometric objects arranged horizontally across the viewport, each with unique lighting and material properties.

## Left Object - Blue Glowing Sphere
- A translucent, highly reflective sphere with a vibrant blue luminescence
- Exhibits strong internal glow and subsurface scattering effects
- Appears to have a metallic or chrome-like material with blue neon lighting
- Creates a bright, glowing halo effect against the dark background
- Positioned at the left third of the scene

## Center Object - Crystalline/Folded Form
- An angular, geometric structure with faceted surfaces
- Features a complex folded or origami-like topology
- Rendered with darker, more muted blue tones compared to the left object
- Has metallic reflective properties with more subdued lighting
- Shows distinct surface facets and creases
- Positioned in the center of the composition

## Right Object - Minimalist Disk with Sphere
- A highly stylized, abstract form
- Composed of a flat, elliptical white disk or platform
- Topped with a small white sphere or orb element
- Maintains the brightest white value in the scene
- Features clean, minimalist design aesthetic
- Uses simple geometric primitives

## Lighting & Materials
- Dramatic three-point or accent lighting setup
- High contrast between luminous objects and pure black background
- Each object has distinct material properties (glossy, reflective, glowing)
- Cool color palette dominated by blues and whites
