# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Setup
This is a professionally rendered 3D portrait bust displayed against a pure black background, created using three.js. The composition uses a clean, minimalist presentation typical of character models or digital sculpture showcases.

## Character Model
The scene features a **realistic human bust** that includes:
- **Head**: Bald, with subtle skin texture and realistic facial features including defined cheekbones, nose, and eye sockets
- **Face**: Neutral expression with forward-facing gaze, rendered with careful attention to anatomical proportions
- **Neck and Shoulders**: Extends to mid-chest, providing anatomical context
- **Skin Material**: Appears to use a skin shader with realistic subsurface scattering, showing natural skin tone variations and subtle surface details

## Lighting
The scene employs **strategic 3-point or key lighting**:
- Soft directional light from the upper left/front
- Subtle ambient lighting that reveals form without harsh shadows
- Strategic use of shadow on one side of the face for dimensional depth
- Highlights on the forehead, nose, and cheekbones enhance three-dimensionality

## Technical Execution
- **Rendering Quality**: High polygon count with smooth surface subdivision
- **Texture Detail**: Visible pore-level detail and subtle color variation in skin
- **Background**: Pure black (likely #000000) for maximum contrast and focus
- **Presentation**: Centered, symmetrical framing ideal for portfolio or character selection interfaces

This type of scene is commonly used in game development, VR applications, character creation tools, or 3D art portfolios.
