# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a Three.js rendered 3D scene depicting a geometric interior space with a modern, minimalist aesthetic. The scene uses bold primary colors and clean architectural forms to create a striking visual composition.

## Environment Structure

**Floor:** A light gray/white plane extending into the distance, providing a neutral base for the scene.

**Walls:** 
- The left wall is a vibrant red plane angled inward
- The right wall is a bright lime green plane, mirroring the left wall's angle
- Both walls converge toward the back, creating a perspective effect
- The rear wall is a soft magenta/pink color, contrasting warmly with the primary colors of the side walls

**Ceiling:** A magenta/pink plane matching the rear wall, completing the enclosed space above.

## Interior Elements

**Floating Objects:** Two symmetrical blue/purple cube-like structures are positioned in the middle-ground, slightly elevated from the floor:
- Each appears to have small white geometric details (possibly representing windows or light fixtures)
- They are spaced evenly on either side of the center line
- These elements break up the empty space and add focal interest

## Lighting & Atmosphere
- The scene uses direct, even lighting that clearly defines the geometry
- Colors are saturated and highly contrasted
- Black areas frame the edges, emphasizing the contained space
- The overall mood is contemporary and architectural

This appears to be either an architectural visualization, a game environment, or an abstract 3D art piece showcasing geometric principles and color theory.
