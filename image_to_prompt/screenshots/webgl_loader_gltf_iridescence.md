# Three.js Scene Description

## Composition & Lighting
This is a beautifully rendered 3D scene featuring a sophisticated **table lamp setup** positioned in what appears to be an idealized outdoor plaza environment. The scene demonstrates masterful use of **image-based lighting (IBL)** and environment mapping to create photorealistic reflections and ambient illumination.

## Primary Objects

### Lamp Assembly
- **Shade**: A cylindrical, matte brown fabric lampshade with subtle gradient shading
- **Bulb**: A perfectly spherical glass bulb that acts as a major focal point, displaying crystal-clear reflections of the surrounding environment
- **Base**: A minimalist pedestal base supporting the lamp structure
- **Stand**: A thin, elegant stem connecting the base to the shade

### Environment
The scene showcases a **mirrored environment map** displaying:
- A European plaza or courtyard setting
- Historic architecture with warm terracotta/brick-colored buildings
- Clear blue sky with soft clouds
- Green foliage and mature trees
- Classical urban architecture suggesting an Italian or Mediterranean locale

## Lighting Technique
The glass bulb acts as a **perfect mirror and light transmitter**, capturing:
- Specular reflections of the plaza and sky
- Caustic light interactions through the spherical geometry
- Soft, diffuse illumination from the environment map
- Realistic depth-of-field in reflected elements

## Visual Style
- **Photorealistic rendering** with attention to material accuracy
- **Warm color temperature** with golden hour lighting characteristics
- **Professional product visualization** aesthetic
- High-quality anti-aliasing and shadow rendering

This is an excellent example of product visualization in a contextual, aspirational setting.
