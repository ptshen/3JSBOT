# 3D Scene Description: Golden Duck Composition

## Overall Aesthetic
This is a sophisticated three.js rendered scene featuring a minimalist, luxury aesthetic with warm golden tones against a stark contrast backdrop.

## Main Objects
**Three Golden Ducks** - Arranged in a diagonal composition:
- Each duck features a polished, metallic gold material with high specularity
- The ducks appear to be simple, stylized rubber duck forms with characteristic rounded bodies and small beaks
- Graduating in size from front to back, creating depth and visual hierarchy
- The largest duck is positioned in the foreground-left, with progressively smaller ducks receding into the background

## Lighting & Shading
- **Key Light**: A dramatic spotlight positioned above and to the left, creating strong directional illumination
- **Material Properties**: The ducks display excellent specular highlights and reflective properties, suggesting a polished plastic or ceramic material
- **Shadow Rendering**: Deep, well-defined shadows cast onto the floor, enhancing the three-dimensional presence and spatial depth
- **Lighting Quality**: Professional studio-style lighting with careful attention to creating visual drama and depth

## Environment
- **Floor**: A light wooden surface with subtle grain texture and warm undertones, complementing the golden color palette
- **Background**: Dark (near-black), creating maximum contrast that makes the golden objects pop
- **Ambient Environment**: Minimalist and clean, focusing all attention on the subject matter

## Technical Qualities
- Sharp focus and professional depth-of-field effects
- Excellent shadow mapping and anti-aliasing
- Realistic material physics and light interaction
- High-quality render demonstrating advanced three.js capabilities

This scene exemplifies contemporary 3D product visualization with an artistic, whimsical twist.
