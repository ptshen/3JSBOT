# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a three.js rendered 3D scene displaying a stylized computer monitor or window interface suspended in a neutral, light gray virtual space. The scene uses a simple, clean aesthetic with minimal environmental elements.

## Primary Object: Monitor/Window Frame
- **Frame**: A bold, bright blue border forms a rectangular frame, approximately in landscape orientation
- **Frame Style**: The blue material appears to be a solid, slightly beveled edge that gives the frame subtle dimensionality
- **Screen Composition**: The display is divided into two distinct sections:
  - **Left Panel** (approximately 25% of width): A light blue/white sidebar containing what appears to be a vertically stacked navigation or menu interface with subtle horizontal divisions
  - **Right Panel** (approximately 75% of width): A soft mint/turquoise green area, likely representing a main content viewing space or dashboard

## Lighting & Atmosphere
- **Ambient Lighting**: Even, soft lighting illuminates the scene without harsh shadows
- **Background**: A subtle gradient gray environment with faint horizon lines suggesting a 3D space
- **Shading**: The blue frame demonstrates basic depth through subtle shadowing on its beveled edges

## Perspective & Camera
- The monitor is viewed from a slightly elevated, three-quarter angle
- The camera positioning creates a natural, immersive viewing perspective
- Subtle perspective lines suggest the monitor is receding into the virtual space

## Overall Impression
A clean, modern UI/UX visualization, possibly representing a dashboard, application interface, or design mockup rendered in an immersive 3D environment.
