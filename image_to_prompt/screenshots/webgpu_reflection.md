# 3D Scene Description: Pixelated Flower

## Overall Composition
This is a voxel-based 3D render of a stylized flower constructed entirely from cubic blocks, executed in a blocky, Minecraft-like aesthetic typical of three.js scenes.

## Structural Elements

**Flower Head:**
- The bloom consists of approximately 50-100 cubic voxels arranged in organic, petal-like formations
- Deep crimson red (#8B0000 range) forms the dominant flower petals
- The petals radiate outward in an asymmetrical, naturalistic pattern rather than geometric precision
- Subtle dark purple/maroon (#4B0082) shading provides depth and dimensionality to the bloom

**Stem & Support:**
- A cylindrical stem extending downward, composed of jade/forest green (#20B2AA) voxels
- The stem tapers slightly toward the base, giving subtle perspective
- Approximately 8-10 blocks tall, providing structural connection between flower and ground

## Environment

**Ground Plane:**
- An infinite checkerboard pattern in alternating shades of teal (#20B2AA) and deep blue (#1E90FF)
- Creates strong linear perspective, emphasizing depth
- The pattern extends to the horizon line, grounding the scene

**Lighting & Atmosphere:**
- Cool color temperature dominated by cyan-blue tones
- Soft ambient lighting with minimal harsh shadows
- Gradient background transitioning from lighter teal at the horizon to darker blue at the top
- Subtle vignetting effect darkening the edges

**Overall Mood:** Ethereal, digital, and contemplative—a romantic gesture rendered in the digital medium.
