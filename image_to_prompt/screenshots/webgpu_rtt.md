# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist three.js scene featuring a single geometric object centered against a vibrant blue background.

## Key Elements

**Background:**
- Solid, uniform cobalt blue color (#0052CC or similar)
- Creates strong contrast with the foreground object
- Fills the entire viewport

**Central Object:**
- A **square/cubic mesh** positioned in the upper-center area of the screen
- Dimensions: Appears to be roughly 72x72 pixels
- **Material Properties:**
  - **Gradient Color Mapping**: Features a smooth multi-color gradient
  - **Color Spectrum**: Transitions from:
    - Pink/Magenta (top-left)
    - Purple (top-right)
    - Yellow-Green/Lime (bottom-right)
    - Coral/Orange (bottom-left)
  - **Transparency**: The gradient appears to have subtle alpha/opacity variations, creating a slight transparency effect
  - **Checkerboard Pattern**: Visible grid/checkerboard pattern beneath the gradient, indicating transparency or texture mapping

## Lighting & Rendering
- **Flat Lighting**: Minimal shadows or depth, suggesting orthographic or direct lighting
- **Clean Rendering**: Sharp edges, no bloom or post-processing effects visible
- **No Shadows**: Object appears to float with no ground plane or shadow

## Technical Observations
- Simple scene structure ideal for demonstrating material/texture properties
- Color gradient likely implemented via texture or vertex coloring
- Orthographic camera most likely, given the flat perspective
