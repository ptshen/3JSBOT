# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
The scene presents a striking contrast between two distinct 3D objects displayed against a pure black background, arranged horizontally with generous spacing between them.

## Left Object: Wireframe Rectangular Prism
- **Geometry**: A rectangular box/cuboid rendered in wireframe mode
- **Material**: Pure white lines with no fill, displaying complete edge and diagonal connectivity
- **Structure**: Shows all vertices connected with edges, including internal diagonals creating a complex geometric lattice
- **Perspective**: Rendered in an isometric-like view, revealing depth and dimensionality
- **Style**: Minimalist and technical, emphasizing pure geometric form

## Right Object: Textured Rectangular Prism
- **Geometry**: A matching rectangular box/cuboid, similar proportions to the left object
- **Material**: Terracotta/rust-colored brick texture with realistic surface detail
- **Surface**: Displays weathered brick-like pattern with subtle color variations and surface imperfections
- **Lighting**: Softly lit with minimal shadows, allowing the texture detail to be clearly visible
- **Style**: Photorealistic and tactile in appearance

## Lighting & Atmosphere
- **Background**: Pure black void providing maximum contrast
- **Illumination**: Even, diffused lighting suggesting neutral three-point or ambient lighting setup
- **Shadows**: Minimal to none, focusing attention on the objects themselves

## Artistic Intent
This composition appears to demonstrate the contrast between **mathematical abstraction** (wireframe) and **material reality** (textured surface), effectively showcasing three.js capabilities in rendering both procedural and textured geometries.
