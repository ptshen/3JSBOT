# Three.js Molecular Visualization Scene

## Overall Composition
This is a high-quality 3D molecular structure visualization rendered in Three.js against a dark charcoal background. The scene features a complex organic molecule rendered with professional scientific accuracy and visual polish.

## Molecular Structure
The molecule appears to be a **heterocyclic compound** (likely a pyrimidine or imidazole derivative) with the following characteristics:

- **Central Core**: A multi-membered aromatic ring system featuring nitrogen atoms (shown in blue) integrated into the ring structure
- **Ring System**: Approximately 5-6 membered rings with alternating single and double bonds
- **Substituent Groups**: Various functional groups extending from the central nucleus

## Atomic Representation

**Atom Colors:**
- **White spheres**: Hydrogen atoms
- **Blue elements**: Nitrogen atoms (part of the ring system)
- **Red atoms**: Oxygen atoms (likely carbonyl or hydroxyl groups)
- **Dark/Gray**: Carbon atoms (forming the backbone)

## Visual Styling

**Rendering Quality:**
- Clean, anti-aliased geometry
- Realistic sphere proportions matching van der Waals radii
- Smooth bond connections (cylinders) between atoms
- Professional ambient lighting creating subtle shadows and depth

**Lighting:**
- Soft three-point lighting setup
- Strategic highlights on atomic spheres
- Ambient occlusion-like shading for depth perception
- Minimal specular highlights for clarity

## Camera & Perspective
- Slight isometric-like angle showing multiple faces of the molecule
- Optimal distance for viewing the complete structure without distortion
- Central composition with balanced white space

This appears to be a **pharmaceutical or biochemical visualization**, commonly used in drug discovery, chemistry education, or molecular biology applications.
