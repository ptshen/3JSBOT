# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a professional 3D rendered scene featuring a stylized steering wheel as the central subject, rendered with sophisticated lighting and material properties typical of high-quality three.js implementations.

## Central Object - Steering Wheel
- **Design**: Modern, minimalist steering wheel with a circular grip and hub structure
- **Material**: Matte gray/charcoal finish with subtle surface details
- **Branding**: "HD" logo prominently displayed on the wheel's center hub, suggesting this may be a demonstration for a design or automotive company
- **Geometry**: Three-spoke design with clean, contemporary proportions
- **Surface Quality**: Smooth, professional finish with realistic reflectivity

## Lighting & Shading
- **Primary Light Source**: Soft, diffuse overhead lighting creating gentle shadows and dimensional depth
- **Material Response**: The wheel exhibits realistic Phong or PBR (Physically Based Rendering) materials with appropriate specularity
- **Shadow Casting**: Subtle shadow beneath the wheel enhances spatial grounding

## Environment
- **Background**: Neutral gray gradient creating a clean, professional backdrop
- **Ground Plane**: Light gray surface that grounds the object and provides context
- **Ambient Lighting**: Carefully balanced to prevent harsh shadows while maintaining contrast

## Technical Elements - Gizmo Display
- **Axis Indicator**: Three-axis gizmo in the upper right corner (red, green, and blue arrows representing X, Y, and Z axes)
- **Additional Axis Point**: Secondary control point visible in the scene
- **Purpose**: These are typical development/debugging tools used in three.js scenes for object manipulation and orientation reference

## Overall Aesthetic
Professional, clean, and corporate - suitable for product visualization, automotive design presentation, or interactive 3D web application demonstration.
