# Three.js 3D Scene Description

## Overview
This is a striking visualization of two identical male head busts rendered in a modern, stylized aesthetic against a pure black background.

## Lighting & Materials
- **Advanced Lighting Setup**: The scene employs a sophisticated multi-light system with warm (pink/magenta) and cool (cyan/turquoise) colored lights positioned at different angles
- **Material Properties**: The heads feature a semi-translucent, glossy material with high specularity, allowing light to penetrate and scatter through the geometry
- **Color Grading**: A vibrant neon color palette dominates—magenta, cyan, and lime green create a cyberpunk aesthetic reminiscent of synthwave visual culture

## Geometry & Modeling
- **Head Sculpting**: Both busts display anatomically accurate facial features with subtle detail in the cheekbones, jawline, and nasal structure
- **Base/Bust**: Each figure includes a simplified neck and shoulder section typical of classical sculpture presentation
- **Symmetry**: Perfect mirrored positioning creates a balanced, compositional layout

## Composition
- **Spatial Arrangement**: The two heads are positioned equidistant from center, facing forward with a slight downward gaze
- **Depth**: The busts appear to float against the void, with consistent lighting suggesting they occupy the same three-dimensional space

## Technical Aspects
- **Rendering Quality**: Clean geometry with smooth shading and minimal artifacts
- **Post-Processing**: Likely includes bloom/glow effects enhancing the neon aesthetic
- **Color Space**: Uses HSL or similar color manipulation for the gradient transitions across the forms

This exemplifies contemporary digital art using three.js for creating compelling, gallery-quality 3D visualizations.
