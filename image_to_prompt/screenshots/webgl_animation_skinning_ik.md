# Detailed Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a warmly-lit interior scene rendered in three.js, featuring a modern, minimalist living room with a soft, illustration-like aesthetic. The color palette is dominated by soft pastels—mint green walls, warm wood tones, and golden accents—creating a cozy, inviting atmosphere.

## Lighting
- **Soft, diffused illumination** suggests multiple light sources, likely including ambient lighting and a directional light from the left window
- **Warm golden tones** from what appears to be a desk lamp, creating gentle shadows and depth
- **Natural window light** streaming from the left, creating realistic spatial depth

## Environment Details

**Walls & Architecture:**
- Mint-green colored walls with subtle texture
- Large window on the left with a gridded pane design and curtains, suggesting afternoon light

**Flooring:**
- Polished wooden or laminate floor with a warm, natural tone
- Subtle reflectivity indicating careful material rendering

## Furniture & Objects

**Seating:**
- Two gray upholstered armchairs on the left
- A prominent **yellow armchair** in the foreground, where the main character sits
- A **wooden dresser/chest of drawers** behind the yellow chair

**Accessories:**
- A **yellow desk lamp** mounted or standing, providing warm accent lighting
- White objects on the right (possibly decorative items or storage)

## Character
- **Female figure** with black hair and a black cap
- Wearing a **red/burgundy long-sleeved top** and gray pants
- **Holding a globe or spherical object**, suggesting curiosity or educational themes
- Seated in a relaxed pose on the yellow chair
- Soft, stylized rendering consistent with modern 3D illustration

## Art Style
The scene demonstrates professional three.js rendering with:
- Smooth, non-photorealistic geometry
- Clean material definitions with subtle specular highlights
- Careful color theory application for mood
- Simplified but expressive character design
- Strong composition and depth of field

This appears to be a concept art or illustration piece, possibly for educational, storytelling, or portfolio purposes.
