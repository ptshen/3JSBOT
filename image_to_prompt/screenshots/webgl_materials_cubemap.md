# Three.js Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a striking nighttime installation featuring three large-scale, luminous head sculptures arranged in a row across an urban plaza. The scene demonstrates advanced three.js rendering capabilities with sophisticated lighting and material properties.

## The Three Heads

### Left Head (Gold/Bronze)
- **Material**: Polished metallic surface with warm gold tones
- **Finish**: Highly reflective, mirror-like quality
- **Expression**: Serene, classical aesthetic with subtle facial features
- **Lighting**: Warm ambient glow reflecting the surrounding environment

### Center Head (Black/Dark)
- **Material**: Matte black with skeletal or skull-like appearance
- **Expression**: Dramatic, possibly skull-faced or gothic aesthetic
- **Contrast**: Stark contrast to its neighbors, creating visual drama
- **Details**: Fine surface detail suggesting intricate modeling

### Right Head (Luminous Yellow)
- **Material**: Self-illuminating or internally lit yellow material
- **Glow**: Bright, radioactive-quality luminescence
- **Expression**: Friendly, approachable demeanor with a subtle smile
- **Effect**: Acts as a primary light source in the composition

## Environmental Context
- **Setting**: Historic European plaza with classical architecture
- **Time**: Twilight/night (deep blue sky with residual light)
- **Background**: Period buildings with lit windows suggesting an urban cultural space
- **Ground**: Wet or reflective surface (possibly rain or artistic design)

## Technical Rendering
- **Lighting**: Complex multi-light setup with directional and point lights
- **Materials**: PBR (Physically Based Rendering) with varying metallicity and roughness
- **Scale**: Monumental proportions suggesting public art installation
- **Atmosphere**: Sophisticated depth-of-field and color grading

This appears to be a contemporary art installation visualization showcasing advanced three.js capabilities.
