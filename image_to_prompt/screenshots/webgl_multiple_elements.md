# Three.js Scene Description

This screenshot displays a collection of six 3D rendered objects arranged in a 2x3 grid layout, each contained within its own framed panel labeled as different scenes.

## Scene Breakdown:

**Scene 1 (Top Left):** A solid royal blue rectangular prism or cube, positioned against a light gray background with white framing, creating a minimalist presentation.

**Scene 2 (Top Center):** A teal/cyan colored rectangular solid, similar in form to Scene 1 but with a cooler color tone. The uniform lighting creates clean, subtle shadows on the gray background.

**Scene 3 (Top Right):** A polyhedron (appears to be a dodecahedron or similar multi-faceted geometric form) rendered in yellow-green and olive tones. The faceted design creates visible depth through contrasting light and shadow on different planes, demonstrating 3D geometry complexity.

**Scene 4 (Bottom Left):** A teal/turquoise polyhedron with similar geometric complexity to Scene 3, featuring multiple faces with varying shades created by directional lighting to enhance dimensionality.

**Scene 5 (Bottom Center):** A cylindrical form rendered in medium green with visible layering or segmentation, showing depth through subtle shadow variations along its surface.

**Scene 6 (Bottom Right):** A bright lime-green rectangular prism or cube, matching the simple geometric approach of Scenes 1 and 2 but with vibrant coloring.

The overall presentation appears to be a portfolio or demo showcasing basic 3D geometric primitives with varied materials and lighting conditions.
