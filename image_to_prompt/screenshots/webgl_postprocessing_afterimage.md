# 3D Scene Description

## Overall Composition
This is a minimalist three.js scene featuring a single geometric object rendered against a pure black background, creating a stark and focused composition.

## Primary Element
**Blue Square/Cube**
- A light periwinkle or lavender-blue colored square positioned in the upper-center portion of the viewport
- The shape appears to be a flat square or potentially a cube viewed directly from the front
- The color is a soft, desaturated blue (#C0C0FF approximate range)
- Sharp, clean edges with no visible anti-aliasing artifacts
- Positioned approximately in the upper-middle area of the frame

## Lighting & Materials
- **Ambient/Directional Lighting**: The object appears evenly lit with no visible shadows or gradients on its surface, suggesting either basic ambient lighting or a frontal light source
- **Material**: Appears to be a basic material with flat shading (likely MeshBasicMaterial or similar in three.js)
- No reflections, specular highlights, or complex material properties visible

## Environment
- **Background**: Pure black (#000000), likely set as a clear color rather than a textured environment
- **Atmosphere**: Clean, sterile, gallery-like presentation
- No visible floor plane, grid, or environmental references

## Technical Notes
This appears to be a basic three.js setup demonstrating fundamental rendering capabilities with simple geometry and lighting.
